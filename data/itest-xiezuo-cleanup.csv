"1. 很多人认为有必要举行口语考试，理由是
2. 也有人持反对意见
3. 我的看法及原因
","A test of spoken English will be included as an optional (component of the College English Test (CET). Some people contend that it is absolutely necessary to hold a test of spoken English in China because we have been told many times that a Chinese student who has been learning English for years cannot communicate with a native English speaker. Sometimes even those top students who excel at grammar and writing skills find their English inadequate to express their thoughts freely when speaking. A test of spoken English will bring the importance of speaking English to the awareness of the college students, and thus help them with their communicating skills.

On the other hand, there are also people who maintain that good reading and writing skills would be enough for the average English learners. College students are already under considerable pressure from their coursework. Another required test will only add to their burden. Also, some students may take the shortcut and only practice the questions according to the fixed format of the test, which will not actually improve their spoken English.

I believe that a test of spoken English will do more good than harm. Since China will continue its policy of openingand reform, the ability to speak fluent English is a must for anyone who wants to surpass others in a highly competitive society. Whether I take the test or not, I shall make all efforts to practice my spoken English in the rest years in college.

"@@Should Career Planning Be Done Early?@@

1. 通常，在大学中学习的专业决定了将来从事的工作

2. 有些学生入大学前就有了职业规划

3. 有些学生入大学后寻找就业方向

4. 我的观点
","Should Career Planning Be Done Early?

What we learn as our major at college determines what kind of job we are to take after graduation to a great extent.

Some students, before entering the college, start to think about their job prospects. They are strong-minded and purposeful. They have a thorough knowledge about themselves: they know the relative strengths and weaknesses of their personality; they know their interests and specialties. With a right choice of a satisfactory major, they are making steady progress to their potential career at college.

Some students, however, are not as decisive as the above ones. They are confused about their future jobs. Blindly, they choose their major, but quickly lose the interest in pursuing it or find it unsuitable for themselves. They spend the whole college period doing nothing but complaining and regretting.

In my opinion, it is essential for students to make a right choice of major before they start their college study. Both schools and parents have to take the responsibility of cultivating youngsters’ sense of career planning and sense of independence. Only in this way, can college life be a happy and beneficial experience for more students.
","","此作文是一篇讨论大学生职业规划的议论文。根据提纲，考生首先需要交待进行职业规划的背景，其次对比对待职业规划的不同态度，最后通过对比的结果得出大学生应该尽早进行职业规划的结论，属于观点对比题。范文首先指出大学生在校所学专业在很大程度上决定其职业的方向。第二段分析提早进行职业规划的好处：一些学生在入学前就开始思考自己的职业问题，他们对自身的性格、特长、兴趣更为了解，因而能够选择合适的专业，在择业的时候能够更有针对性；第三段则讨论反面的例子：另外一些学生对自己的职业毫无规划，对所学专业没有兴趣，虚度了大学时光。最后，作者总结大学生在入学前有必要选择好自己的专业。而学校和家长也应引导学生培养职业规划的意识和独立意识。只有这样，大学生活才能有意义。

"1. Write a short summary of the news item, which should include: ? Teenager smoking in China ? The role of government in keeping teenagers from smoking 2. Give your comments on the theme of Tobacco-Free Youth.
","","","China's production and consumption of cigarettes have ranked first in the world. One of every three cigarettes manufactured in the world is consumed in China. Three of every five Chinese smokers begin smoking at the age of 15–20 years. Teenage smoking is increasingly becoming a problem in modern China. At least 50 million of the children now living in China will be killed by smoking. Therefore China's top priority in control of smoking is to educate the youth against smoking so as to prevent them from starting and reduce the overall number of new smokers. Adults smoke; children follow. Thus a major feature of China's smoking control efforts has been the mobilization of primary school children to advise their parents to stop smoking. The goal of the Chinese Association on Smoking and Health is to achieve a male (age 15+) smoking rate below 58% and a female (age 15+) smoking rate below 5% by the year 2000. Although the number of smoke-free schools is on the increase and many more teenagers are quitting, China still has a long way to go. f1 Reprint requests and correspondence should be addressed to Tsung O.

* Government's solutions to protect the Nature Reserve in Caohai

* The corresponding influences on both the environment and residents' life there

2. Give your suggestion on how to protect the environment and develop economy at the same time to achieve sustainable development.
","Caohai Nature Reserve, a wetland in Guizhou province, is home to more than 400 wild species. In these years, to protect the environment, the local government here has taken strict actions. They closed many small factoriesand set limits on fishingso asto expand the size of the wetland.

These polices have already resulted in desirable effects. More and more birds are coming here for winter because of the improved environment, including some rare ones.

However, due to these actions, residents there get less income, and their houses will be submerged after the expansion of the Caohai Lake. They are going to live a poor life if further solutions can't be made.

So how can we protect the environment successfully and develop our economy at the same time? The answer is sustainable development. Before we take actions to protect the environment, detailed plans should be set on how to improve people's life there. Only by alleviating poverty there firstly can our dream of environmental protection be achieved.

"1. Write a short summary of the news item, which should include:

* Problemsfaced bymigrant workers

* The reasons for the problems

2. Give your suggestions about protection ofthe interests of migrant workers.
","The news item is mainly about a migrant worker, called Pu Zibing, who has suffered from black lung for years due to the awful working conditions. From the news item we can learn that there exist some serious problems in this large workforce group, such as severe working environment, ignorance of the workers' health,non-payments, etc. Meanwhile, the news also makes ankeen revelation of the fact that some local governments usually put enterprises' interests over themigrant workers'.

The news item tries to warn us that some measures should be taken immediately to protect migrant workers' interests and rights. In my opinion, there are two effective solutions to the problems. One is that our government should perfect some relevant laws as soon as possible, and punish enterprises' illegal acts; the other, more importantly, is that migrant workers should actively learn to have law awareness so that they can protect their rights.

In conclusion, our society, as a whole, should take the responsibility for improving the well-being of migrant workers and ensure their interests and rights.

"1. Write a short summary of the news item, which should include:

* the increase in the number of students
* the reasons for the increase

2. Give your suggestions on what college students should do to prepare for their career after graduation.
","As is reported, there has been an increase in the number of students who register in schools in the new semester. Even if they go to or return to school for different reasons, the rise is mainly due to the economic depression, which may teach us, college students now, a lot for our future development.

To my way of thinking, in this falling economy, it is advisable for us to start earlier to better prepare ourselves for our future career, rather than wait until right before the graduation. First of all, we need to prepare theoretically, which means, we need to master as much professional knowledge and information as possible. Secondly, as we all know, the society favors people with work experiences.It is therefore important to get some opportunities to have more social practices, like part-time jobs or work in student associations. But most of all, we need to think clearly what we want to do in the future and set ourselves a goal and strive for it.

"How to improve psychological health of college students?

1. Write a short summary of the video and include the following in your summary:

*

The connection between dreams and one's thoughts;

*

Examples of interpretation of dreams;

2. Give your suggestions as to how to keep a healthy lifestyle psychologically.
","The video illustrates the relations between dreams and real life activities. No matter what kind of dream we have during the night, experts are confident to tell us that there will be some explanations which are closely related to what we do during the day. For example, a woman named Lisa has a dream which might be triggered by her moving to another city or changing a job. Several other people have certain dreams which may be explained by the fact that they are experiencing important life events, such as marriage or the loss of family members. In all these cases, the experts are sure that dreams can actually act as a guide for us to release the pressure deep in our mind.

Perhaps dreaming is indeed a way of relieving pressure. At the same time, we have seen several shocking news about college students committing suicide because they are under great pressure from study or from interpersonal relationships. In addition, more students are complaining about the stress they have to cope with while they are still in college, not to mention in society after they step out of colleges. In order to prevent more tragedies, the psychological health of college students should be the priority of administrators and educators in colleges. As for students themselves, there are also methods to make them stronger psychologically. They can join some societies to meet more people, seek advice from the school teachersor tutors, and develop more hobbies to enrich their college life, to name but a few. Everyone tends to agree that college students today will be the major labor force of the future, and in order to secure a happy life and a harmonious society, all of us should pay great attention to the psychological health of college students.

* Cheating as a widespread problem in American universities

* Who's been helping students cheat

2. Write a short essay on the theme of Prevent Cheating on Campus.
","From the news report, we can tell cheating has become a very common phenomenon in American universities. It seems that students who fear to fail a course will naturally turn to cheating. Besides, the wide use of the Internet has facilitated students' cheating. For example, students can easily put orders and buy essays online since many websites have been established to meet such needs of college students.

Similarly, China is also faced with the same challenge of preventing cheating on campus. To prevent such shameful behaviors, schools and related departments should impose severe punishments on both cheaters and people who help students cheat. Besides, schools should also encourage academic honesty by reminding students that they will learn little if they pass exams by cheating. In this way, we can maintain academic honesty on campus and create a favorable academic atmosphere for students.

"1. Write a short summary of the video clip, which should include: ?

* The main content of this video ?

* The example of Bush's and Putin's body language

2. Give your comments on how to use body language to enhance your speech.
","Although the spoken words are important, even more important than that is your body language. This video not only shows that body language always tells the truth but also equips us with the methods of reading the non-verbal clues. Celebrities in different fields are chosen as the examples in this program. Their body language helps to express themselves and also reveals their secrets. One of the examples is the meeting between President Putin and President Bush, both of whom display their great power through their body movements. President Putin walks with his shoulders bouncing back and forth. In contrast, President Bush shows his more traditional power, with little movement above the shoulders.

As is introduced in this program, body language is crucial in our daily life. For instance, body language has a large impact on the speech presentation. Firstly, eye contact adds conviction and meaning to every word you say. Without it, your speech is just a mess of words. Secondly, gestures help you tell a story effectively or drive home a main point. Last but not least, your posture is another important speech language form. Developing a firm, upright posture will contribute to your speech. In a word, using body language will enhance your speech delivery.

"April 1st is a day designed for pranks. Conficker, a computer worm, is said to launch on April 1st. It first surfaced in last October, targeting computers using Microsoft's Windows software. According to the researchers, it is first created as a complex computer program and sent out through the Internet. Landing in servers, it then searches to hack into computers with weak network passwords, old anti-virus software or Windows software not recently updated. Once inside, it creates a so-called ""zombie computer"" that could be controlled by the worm's designer. The worm now has spread and evolved into a threat to multiple millions of computers in the Internet. Analysts say it's programmed to become active on April 1. No matter it is hype or a hacker's hoax, the Internet security experts are taking this threat very seriously.

","","","A report says that there are millions of people downloading illegally in the UK. By downloading illegally, people can easily get free access to materials worth billions. So the report suggests that the government should pay attention to consumers’ attitudes to illegal downloading since it may infringe on the copyright of some works. But it also pointed out that simply punishing downloaders may cost a lot but earn little. Actually, with the popularization of the Internet, illegal downloading has become a worldwide problem. Getting free materials from the Internet may be one of the most common things that lots of net users do everyday. Some people from the creative industries believe that illegal downloading will definitely stifles innovation and threatens the long term health of the business. And illegal downloading, which can be compared with stealing, should be punished by law. However, others don’t think so. Some net users believe that the soul of Internet is sharing. Besides, there is no sound evidence that file-sharing has negative effects on product selling. People may hold different ideas, but it is obvious that illegal downloading will do no good to the right owners. We can’t just get something from others for free without the owners’ permission even it is not something concrete with shape. Reasonable people agree that copyright owners should be paid for their work. However, just like the report says: simply calling every downloader a criminal may be a very bad idea. Besides making some legislation, we need to increase the copyright protection consciousness of the net users. And self-regulation may be the best option in this field.

However, it is never too late to take environmental protection measures. First, governments can support research and encourage companies to develop vehiclesto cause less pollution. They should also support alternative sources of electricity from wind and water. Second, we should make laws to limit the amount of greenhouse gases. Finally, it is important that everyone takes part in the problem-solving process and raise awareness in the general public.

In summary, we can do a lot to protect the environment with our willingness and we can definitely make huge progress in environmental protection.

","Happiness may mean different things to different people. According to the speakers I've just heard, it can be the quality time spent with friends and family or just a slow pace of life. Indeed, one can get the purest and greatest happiness from feeling being accompanied. And if a person has the time to smell flowers and appreciate every little wonder of nature, what else would he hope for?

However, to others, that may not be the true happiness in modern life, where most of us are pressured to rush through daily life for fear that we may lag behind others. Pushed by the saying ""Time is money,"" who would be willing to slow down their pursuit of the powerful weapon—money?

I can't help wondering, ""Is money the most important factor in determining our sense of happiness?"" The answer to this is a definite ""no"" for my part. To my understanding, happiness is a feeling that is not solely based on possession of material things. A king or a millionaire would worry about other things if not about money. And a beggar can find his moments of joy in an unexpected discovery of food source. So I think the ultimate source of happiness may be ourselves. Be the master of yourself, and you will be the master of happiness.

This leads to the concern about heart disease and other illnesses, while an excessive diet can also lead to serious illness—anorexia nervosa.

However, there are many ways to keep fit. Firstly, one should keep a healthy diet as experts suggest. Get rid of bad habits, such as smoking and drinking, which will be harmful. Secondly, one should exercise regularly. Jogging, swimming and bicycling are all good choices. At the same time, exercise may be helpful in resisting diseases.

","In a study, scientists surveyed 167 people who wanted to lose weight and found that the successful subjects, in addition to having fewer high-fat foods in the house, also had fewer TV sets and more exercise equipment.

In my opinion, the main reason for obese people to lose weightis that they want to keep healthy. The risk of death rises with increasing weight. Obesity is now recognized as a major risk factor for heart disease, high blood pressure and some types of cancer.

The following are some effective ways to lose weight.

1) Drink water. Drinking water before meals can make you feel full so that you won't eat too much.

2) Proper exercise. Take a 20-minute walk every day andgradually increase the intensity of workout. Do it at least three times a week.

3) Balanced diet. Keep away from junk food and high fatty food and have a variety of fruits, vegetables, meats, fish and grains every day.

To sum up, maintaining a healthy lifestyle—regular exercise and a balanced diet can help you lose weight and keep healthy.

Rome took control of Britain 2,000 years ago, and it brought a civilization of extraordinary sophistication and refinement; consequently, peace and prosperity thrived. However, dating back to 250AD, invaders from Germany, known as the Anglo-Saxons, poured over the imperial borders. The Roman law, the language, the literature, the religion, all have vanished into dusts.

War is a common procedure to conquer the enemy. It provides a cruel but efficient way to solve a dispute. But as to the nature of war, I personally think it is inhumane and wrong. As is depicted in the video, all the precious Roman treasures were wiped out by the cruel war. In sum, it mercilessly slaughters the innocence with advanced weapons and brings great loss to humankind.

But according to many studies, adolescents, aged 12 to 17, who use alcohol are more likely to report behavioral problems, especially aggressive and criminal behaviors, including fighting, stealing, driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, skipping school, feeling depressed, and deliberately trying to hurt or kill themselves.

For teenagers' parents, the following are some ways of trying to tackle this problem withsome skillsand communication.

The first thing to do is to remember: a huge part of talking is listening. Don't lecture, but sit and explain the dangers of excessive drinking, and the positive aspects of having a healthy lifestyle. Remember to stay calm and to take the time tolisten toresponses. It will make a big difference.

Secondly, teach by example. It's no good telling your children that drinking is bad for them if you yourself are often drunk.

Last but not least, be realistic and recognize peer pressure too. Help adolescents arm themselves with ways to say ""no"" and still be cool, like ""It's too high in calories,"" ""It makes me sick"" or even ""I don't like it!""

"1 Write a short summary of the video clip; 2 Give your comments on How to Become Happier.
","In the video, a professor of psychology talks about how people could become happier. He explains the transition from not owning something to owning it makes us happy but happiness does not last long. Therefore, it is the number of happy things rather than the size of good things that bring us more happiness. He also emphasizes our greatest source of happiness comes from our relationship with family and friends.

I agree with what the professor mentioned. Besides those elements, there are other factors contributing to a happy life. I maintain that holding a balanced and positive attitude toward life also contributes to happiness. We could not be so greedy as to be never satified with our current state of life. We need to value what we have and do what we can to improve our life. In addition, helping others and doing some voluntary work also leads to happiness. We will feel we realize our self value and help to make the world a better place to live in.

In summary, the definitions of happiness vary from person to person. We need to find out what makes ourselves happy and start our pursuit of happiness.

","The scandal disturbing the United Nations Climate Change Conference is named Climate-Gate, which suggests scientists might be trying to hide the decline trend in global temperatures. Therefore, some American politicians urged to stop making climate change laws. But authorities say the larger data still supports the global warming theory.

This scandal has aroused a heated argument: Is science research trustful? Some people say that science research has been focusing on commercial goals, and has been serving personal interests or those of certain organizations. Other people insist that most scientists hold their professional morality, and devote their life to the development and prosperity of human race.

As far as I'm concerned, scientific research is trustful. We have benefited from science research which finds out universal knowledge, invents convenient utilities for our lives, and develops creative technology to improve our society. History and facts speak much louder than scandals.

2. Give your comments on how to deal with the problem of teenage drug abuse.
","Recently, the media reports on teenage drug abuse in Hong Kong increase quickly. A 16-year-old girl has been sentenced to three years in prison for drug trafficking. Besides, many teenagers were involved in drug trafficking and drug selling. Among the recent arrests, some were even secondary school students and the youngest were just fourteen years old. In order to prevent the teenagers from being made use of by the criminals, the official departments launched a series of anti-drug operations and provided help by recommending the teenagers to go to the training centers. Meanwhile, the public show their concern on the extent of this issue.

Teenagers' drug abuse is a dangerous sign of social instability. Therefore, the whole society should pay enough attention to this issue. Firstly, the school should reinforce the anti-drug education. The moment they enter the school, the idea of being away from drugs should be planted deeply in teenagers' hearts. Besides, parents should not just focus on their own jobs and neglect their duty of educating their children. Paying more attention to their children's leisure activities and being alert to their social contacts would contribute to helping teenagers away from drugs. What's more, the government should take more anti-drug operations and hold a zero-tolerant attitude toward drug abuse. It should also pay attention to the construction of spiritual world not just stressing the importance of economic growth. Teenagers need more purified movies, playgrounds, swimming pools and part-time positions not just hanging out aimlessly.

As the old saying goes, ""United we stand, divided we fall."" Only by binding the efforts together can we win in the anti-drug campaign.

As to Teddy's family, since autism can run in a family, the idea that maybe other children also had autism made the mother miserable and at the same time determined to fight against autism.

2. Give your comments on the relationship between holiday celebration and environmental protection.
","Since Christmas plays an irreplaceable role in western countries, and there is a tremendous need of holiday resources, many people express their concern on the deterioration of the environment that results from Christmas celebration.

However, Christmas does not have to be a burden to the environment. With a little effort and creativity, we can reduce the negative impact the holiday season has on the environment to minimum. Firstly, bothartificial trees and live trees would be our options. But neither of them is perfect because the former is non-biodegradable and the latter is non-recycling. Therefore, balled trees become popular because they both satisfy people's holiday needs and take environment into consideration. Secondly, we could decorate the trees with some well-kept old ornaments andenergy-saving bulbs, and wrap the gifts with old T-shirts.

As a matter of fact, holiday celebration and environmental protection are not contradictory. If we think green and buy smart, we will strike a balance between them. For example, if we visit local shops rather than downtown department stores, hours of driving will be saved, which contributes significantly to carbon emission reduction. Besides, holiday provides us an opportunity to reinforce the concept of environment protection. Many green experts and celebrities will volunteer on demonstrating the eco life style. Family members will learn together and refresh their old traditions. What's more, an eco holiday celebration would alsobeautify the environment and blow a fresh air to the old tradition.

Therefore, change our mind first and then we will find that environmental protection also works during holidays.

","Walk Out of the Shadow of Depression

College students today are faced with a lot of stress, most of which has been caused by great academic burden, hard job-hunting, failure in friendship, or money matters, etc. If our stress is not well treated, we arelikely to suffer depression or other serious mental problems.

Here are some of my viewpoints and advice on the issue. First, we should have a right attitude toward troubles we encounter. Life is not a bed of roses, and we definitely will meet some difficulties in our lives. Though we don't like them, they, in a sense, can actually enrich our life and cultivate our characters.

Second, find a right way to relieve stress. It's no shame if we cry or scream when we feel low. We can also talk with our friends, listen to our favorite music or just take a shower. They are alleffective ways torelax ourselves.

Third, when we detect some symptoms of depression, we should not feel hopeless and give up on ourselves. Though the illness of depression is highly complex, it is healable. The feeling of despair will do nothing but corner and hurt ourselves eventually. Getting help, especially from the professionals, is vital for us to walk out of the shadow.

In short, experiences of darkness make the light more beautiful. The pain of being acutely depressed allows you to experience an unbelievable happiness in every day when you aren't depressed and a sense that each of those days is a gift.

2. Give your comments on the advantages of getting a good education.
","Although Bill Gates dropped out of college to start Microsoft, Harvard was a phenomenal experience and provided him with a fascinating academic life. He was academically excellent because he used to sit in a lot of classes that he had not signed up for. On top of that, Gates spent many long nights in the dorm discussing things with lots of people.

One of his biggest memories of Harvard fell in January 1975 when he made a call from his dormitory to a company in New Mexico, offering to sell them software. He was pretty worried that they would refuse to talk to him for he was a student at that moment. Instead they agreed to meet and discuss. From then on, he threw himself into a new existence.

Despite Bill Gates' success, it is not advisable to ignore getting a good education. For my part, having a good education has at least three benefits. Firstly, getting a good education can enrich yourself. The more knowledge you get, the more learned person you will be. Secondly, a good education can supply more job opportunities. Most managers prefer people who are well-educated because they often have a wide range of knowledge. In addition, people who have received higher education contribute more to our society. All in all, a good education brings a good life.

","A world-famous skydiver demonstrates the physics of falling in the video with his own example.It is proved in the science experiment that his average speed depends on the height of his fall. As he falls, he starts to accelerate, so the shorter his fall the less his top speed. The top speed decreases with each falling. So the higher the bungee jump, the faster the jumper will fall. If you want to jump off something very high, and live, you have to find a way to slow yourself down. Changing shape by wearing loose clothes affects air resistance and therefore has a slowing effect.

The popularity of engaging in X-extreme sports has increased in recent years, especially among young people. For many young people, jumping off a tall building or surfing has become the biggest sporting dream.It is not the sports themselves but the excitement that the sports bring about that really fascinates those people. It is true that in many ways, X-extreme sports are just like other sports. They're good for your health. They will make your legs, heart and lungs stronger.

Besides, as more and more people are attracted here, bringing more and more cars, this place is choked up and congested.

What arethe advantages of wind turbines? First of all, wind is a clean, safe and infinite renewable energy source. Each unit of electricity generated from wind turbines reduces global warming. Besides, the noise level around the wind farm is so low that it won't disturb the people around. Last but not least, it won't occupy much space, and the farmers can still use the land below.

As far as I am concerned, we all should spare no efforts to find clean, safe and renewable energy sources for human beings and it is a good start to make a good use of wind turbines now. With global warming threatening our life, we cannot wait. In China, there are enormous available resources, such as wind and solar energy. Therefore, we must learn to use these clean energy sources and reduce to use energy which ruins the environment. Only in this way can we improve our energy security, speed up our economy and avoid negative effects of some energy like coal. Let's go into action now.

","The news is about whether it is worthwhile for students to attend university when we are confronted with current economic recession. The speaker mainly discussed three important issues on college education. Firstly,although college education becomes costly, in the long run, higher education still makes a lot of sense because skills are much needed in the job market. Secondly, to be employable,students need to prepare themselves with related working experience in college. Thirdly, if one decides to attend university, he needs to think carefully about the course to take and the institution to attend.

These issues and suggestions also apply to China. As Chinese culture values education greatly, parents would like to send their children to college at any price. However, students from ruralareasare reconsidering higher education because of the high tuition fee. Nowadays, there are a variety of scholarships and financial assistance offered to studentswith financial difficulties. Because applicable and practical knowledge and skills students learn in college are much needed by China's economy, college education will be paid off in the future. If a young person decides to go to university, he has to rethink which university to go and what kind of major to study, because both will influence his or her future competitive edge in the job market. Additionally, the courses students are going to take also need to be thought carefully in advance to see if they contribute totheir future career and interests. Students need to have awareness of the importance of work experience. The knowledge and skills they learn in college should be applicable and practical. Part-time jobs will help bridge the gap between knowledge and practical work. Thus, one needs to be very clear-minded in terms of attending college.

The technology can be widely applied to healthcare. For instance, mobile phones can support various public health campaigns. People will be informed of the knowledge about disease prevention through text messaging. With mobile technology, not only are patients able to communicate with health workers, consultation and diagnosis over long distances will also become a reality.

Asthe consequence of human beings' irresponsible and short-sighted actions, floods, droughts and other forms of extreme weather frequently occur, whichare the alarm nature has sounded to us.

Now is the time for us to wake upand recognize the gravity of the global threat. Now is the time for us to take determined actions to halt and reverse the worsening trends.

* Which kinds of alternative energy sources are used there

2. Give your comments on the theme of alternative energy sources.
","Some isles in Scotland are hard pressed for energy sources. As these isles are isolated, the National Grid can't find its way there. Their inhabitants have to be self-sufficient. People buy expensive diesel to generate power of their own and many families use peat for cooking and heating.

However, the two ways of consuming energy are unfriendly to the environment. Some people are turning to alternative energy sources. It is windy most of the year, so the long-term solution for them is wind power. Compared with diesel power, wind power is cheap and clean. It can usually provide them with all the energy needed unless the weather is quiet. Thus, the locals' lives have been improved a great deal.

On the global scale, renewable energy sources hold great promise and they will benefit human beings immensely. To avoid an energy crisis and combat global warming, it isessential to rely less on fossil fuels and more on new energy sources such as solar energy and wind power. They have the strong advantages of being both inexhaustible and pollution-free.

* How handwriting is taught

2. Give your opinion on the teaching of handwriting.
","In some people's minds, handwriting has faded to insignificance as computers and voice recognition programs are taking over. It is commonly held that short periods of practice are preferable to longer sessions. Even many experts believe handwriting should not be taught by itself. Rather, it should be merely used as a way for children to express ideas. Though handwriting is still required to be taught in most primary schools, the time is anything but adequate and three-fourths of the teachers are unprepared to teach it. As teachers report, one-fourth of their students have poor handwriting. In the case of high-school students, a lot of them would rather fulfill their assignments with the help of word processing programs.

Personally, I support the teaching of handwriting, which is an integral part of early education. A child is supposed to lay a solid foundation in such basic skills as reading and writing. Teachers have much more to do. They need to spend more time giving children instructions on how to write fluently and clearly. They should also require children to write their homework instead of typing it out.

2. Give your comments on the employment of older people.
","It is generally thought all over the world that old age means disease, poverty and dependence on others. People also worry that there will be a burden for the rest of the population to bear as the number of retirees is on the rise. But the latest study overturns the conventional wisdom. It shows people worldwide are working well into old age.

According to the study, a large proportion of the elderly continue to play an active role in society, making huge contributions to economy. Some are either earning a living through a paid job or doing voluntary work. Others are looking after their aged parents or grandchildren. Apparently, they are still contributors to the society rather than its burdens.

In today's society, aging deserves special attention. Many people with rich work experience in their 60s or even 70s remain quite healthy and energetic. Yet, there is a bias among employers against older job applicants. Therefore, the government needs to create more opportunities for older people to bring their abilities into full play, which will contribute to the well-being of both older people themselves and the society as a whole.

* The advantages of e-cigarettes

* E-cigarettes wouldn't violate no-smoking restrictions in public

2. Give your comments on the topic of ""Smoking Should Be Banned in Public"".
","Although e-cigarettes look like cigarettes, actually they are different. When someone inhales e-cigs, there's no second-hand smoking, no cigarette butts on the floor. There's no lighting up with a match or lighter, either. So technically, e-cigarettes would not seem to violate no-smoking restrictions in public.

While the majority of people will agree with the regulation that smoking should be banned in public, some dissenting and questioning voice can also be heard that this regulation violates the people's freedom.

From my point of view, smoking in public should be prohibitedfor the following reasons:

Firstly, smoking in public areas pollutes the fresh air, and it will potentially catch a fire ifpeople smoke in crowded shopping centers, elevators, airports and hospitals. What's more, smoking without non-smokers' permission is also a kind of disrespected behavior.

Secondly, it is known to everyone that smoking does harm to smokers and the people around them who we call ""passive smokers"". Statistics show that people who smoke heavily will more easily suffer from lung cancer and other diseases than people who do not smoke or lightly smoke.

However, this regulation, on the surface, will take away some of people's freedom, but this doesn't mean they are totally deprived of their right of smoking in their private places.

In one word, smoking in public should be banned, and such practice will both benefit the people themselves, and the environment around us.

Natural disasters are extreme, sudden events caused by environmental factors that injure people and damage property. Notwithstanding, these events are not simple hazards or disasters without human involvement. We often seek temporary social and economic development at the cost of the environment. As we see today, the increased pressure of expanding population has led to the removal of wood plants, which leads to serious desertification. Therefore, I believe human activity has caused serious problems while it has improved the world where we live. It is time for us to realize this hazard and take action to prevent further disasters while making progress.

2. Give your comments on this administrative document concerning e-bikes' bad name as a new cause of traffic accidents.
","Earlier this month, the central government dropped a bombshell: tough new nationwide restrictions on e-bike. There was a heated debate. Officials from Luneng Group, one of China's biggest e-bike makers, complained the new rule could possibly ruin the business.

Though some blame the new rule for its lack of respect for public opinions and for the reasonable and scientific decision-making process, I believe it's quite right for the government to implement the new classification of electric motorbikes. Since e-bikes as a quieter and cleaner alternative to gasoline-powered motor cycles have become the fastest growing form of transportation in China, the number of electric-bike accidents rose, too. In 2001, 34 people were killed in e-bike accidents. In 2007, the number rose to 2,469. And people complain that e-bike riders pay little attention to the rules of the road.

No matter whether it is powered by electricity or gasoline, the rider,as well as all the others,is at risk. The best thing you can do for yourself is to get educated,obey the rules, and ride safely.

Delegates, experts and people who are concerned about the global environment from all over the world, gathered together to take some actions to protect the earth and look for long-term cooperation.

At the conference, the UN's Yvo de Boer pointed out that it was the very time for everyone to make contributions to environmental protection. As far as I see, environmental protection is a must to the whole world and its future. Nowadays, along with the rapid economical development, every nation in the world is emitting more poisonous gas into the air, releasing more pollution to the water and dumping more rubbish to the earth. Naturally, the global environment isgetting worseand we human beings are facing greater challenges now. Provided no action was taken to stop the severe situation, the end of the world wouldn't be too remote. Therefore, it's high time for us to take action.

Protecting the environment is an important mission for us. On the one hand, a healthy environment will guarantee usbetter living conditions, only with which can people live a healthy and cheerful life.

","Young Mothers Give Up College Education

The news suggests that many young women in the US are facingthe problem of making a choice between going tocollege and taking care of their baby while graduating from high school. It is a difficult decision for them.In order to fulfill both,more and more student mothers choose to bring their baby to college classes today.

Young single mothers confront a lot of difficulties. Take the speaker's mother for example.She had her first baby at the age of 16, and had to give up college education for her baby.However, with only a high school education, she couldn't get a jobwith a good salary. Therefore, raising the family and taking good care of the baby became a big problem for her.

Actually, the beginning of motherhood makes things difficult for most young single mothers. They lose many precious opportunities, such as the college education and decent jobs. Without a good salary, the burden of raising a child is too heavy. Hence, it is advisable for girls to make full consideration before having a baby. Furthermore, since a great number of young single mothers are caught in such a dilemma between education and motherhood, it has become a big social issue. I hope society can provide some favorable conditions for young single mothers, so that they can continue their study.

2. Give your comments on whether it is a good idea to sign a contract between parents and schools.
","According to the speaker, parents and teachers should work together to educate children. When it comes to school education, teachers should play a roleof deciding things while parents should be supportive. However, it is often heard that a parent will often go against teachers' sensible decisions concerning the misbehaviors of the kids. It is really harmful in the long run, so many schools turned to home-school contracts to ensure a right order. In the contracts, what is expected of the school, the parents and kids will be clearly put down on paper. In this way, both parents and teachers know the dos and don'ts of their educating responsibilities.

Personally, I think it is a good idea to sign a contract between parents and teachers in case any controversy arises. Society gets more complicated, so does the school. No one knows what will happen, so it is always good to be prepared. What's more, with the contract, maybe more parents will have a clear mind of the proper ways to help their children make it at school. So, let's try it.

","Althoughsome great changes to scenery took place in the mountains, we can feel the effects of the Ice Age in many other places. We can see the largest ice cap there. The useful thing about Iceland is that you have a very clear idea of what happens, not only on the ice, but beyond it. There are all sorts of different looks to the edge of a glacier. Melt water carries various materials down the stream and forms a special scene. The material's constantly being moved around by the streams on the outwash plain, so vegetation never gets the chance to take root. What do not change are the three forces—ice, water and wind—still at work in present-day Iceland.

All the characteristics we have seen are partly due to global warming. The climate change has been taking place worldwide due to the heavy carbon emission and carbon footprint. To protect our home on the earth, we need to pay attention to the cultivation of the concept of green world and the reduction of carbon footprint to keep the world environmentally friendly, making the earth a comfortable place for human beings to live in.

When doing their design of next year's fabric, fabric designers decide to go for a design based on large-scale symbols such as afeather decorationor coat of arms, which will give a feeling of importance and an impact on the viewer. So they use a heavyweight fabric that has a dense texture to aid their design. After a series of whitening, printing, coloring, and tinting, the desirable effect of the fabric is achieved.

It is quite understandable that different people have different interpretation of the same issue.In my view, we should follow the fashion rationally. Fashion changes rapidly.

The tuition for a typical four-year state university is about $9,000 per year while a famous private university may charge as high as $26,000 for yearly tuition, not to mention other fees and living expenses.

Not only can they pay less tuition (about $4,500 per year), but also they can save many expenses by living at home. Therefore, this is attractive to both students and parents, especially in the bad economy.

In China, the average tuition for higher education is $800 per year. Although it seems much lower than thatin America, it is still a heavy burden for many students and their families. However, luckily enough, Chinese students can get the tuition by the following means. First of all, we can get most of the tuition from our parents. Second, scholarships and part-time job incomes can help us solve part of the problem. Third, we can get student loans from state-owned banksat anextremely low interest rate.

","Summary

People usually enjoy speed, but speed is one of the most important factors in serious road accidents. In the UK, hundreds of people are killed in road accidents, and more than 20,000 are injured every year. Well over half of us exceed the speed limit given the chance. The faster the driver goes, the greater the chance of losing control and the less time he has to react if anything does go wrong. British researchers have developed an intelligent system to control car speed. And the system is recommended to be put into use in the UK over the next two decades.

Comments

Drink driving is a major killer all around the world, despite so many campaigns to get rid of this. These deaths by drink driving can be stopped if all the drivers promise not to drink a drop before driving. The deaths can also be prevented by police checks, as well as severe punishment for those drink drivers. Meanwhile, all drivers should take their responsibilities and remember that never drive after drinking. As long as a driver has drunk, he should not drive after that, no matter how conscious he claims to be. There are a lot of ways to go home, such as taking a taxi, using the public transportation, or just arranging a lift with someone who has not drunk. If everyone treasures our lives, I'm sure that our world will be much safer.

","Hollywood movies or blockbusters are a household name for most college students, but not many may have heard of the ""Hollywood"" sign—a nine-letter sign erected on a hill that represents the place producing those famous movies. From what we've just listened to, we learn that the sign has been ""endangered"" at least twice, facing the risk of being demolished, but fortunately saved by donations from people like Playboy Companyfounder Hefner. To them, it is more a historic symbol than just a sign. That is why they are willing to spend so much preserving this sign of great historic significance.

Then we can't help asking ourselves, ""Is it important to preserve historic buildings in a city's modern development?""In other words, can we replace the old buildings with modern ones in urban planning?

Personally I believe that the importance of maintaining the historic buildings of a city could outweigh the value of replacing them with modern buildings. Every building has its own historical background, especially historic buildings from which we can learn something specifically about the history of our city. And history has always been part of our life. That explains why the Forbidden City is on the Top Priority List of Renovation in our country. Furthermore, historic buildings would accentuate a city's culture and characteristics. Although a new modern city will usually be built near the old one inthe city's expansion, the most attractive part is still the old city which has many historic buildings. A case in point is Yu Garden in Shanghai. Finally, we have the responsibility of preserving historic buildings forfuture generations so that they will have the opportunity to know the past.

All in all, I would say a city's development should not be done at the cost of ancient buildings without sound justifications. It's our responsibility to protect historic buildings—part of our culture and history.

* The reasons for college students to play too much

2.Give your comments on the theme of how to enjoy childhood.
","In college, students usually start to live and study independently; they are left to make use of their own time when their parents are not around. Therefore, some of them take advantage of the freedom to play day and night, leaving their studies behind. The reason why some students overplay themselves is that they want to gain back the free time they lost in their childhood.

A report of China Youth Daily says that more than half of college students had little time to play when they were kids.Children usually spend most of their time studying at school and at home. What is more,they are forced to join classes after schoolto study English, painting, music instruments and others. As a result, most kids have little time to enjoy their childhood.

From my point of view, after school parents should give their children sufficient time to play in the open air because playing is essential to the overall development of young kids.

2. Offer some suggestions on what we individuals can do to protect the environment.
","A conference, attended by 380 delegates from big airlines, is being held to discuss greener operations. The companies, which are traditionally rivals to each other, have now come together with a view to finding ways to protect the environment.

The agenda for the meeting is to reduce CO2 emissions. Through heated debates, the industry is trying to seek cleaner fuels as an alternative to oil and to think of producing fuel-efficient planes. Some airports are setting an example in recycling their waste.

Personally, I believe that the responsibility of environmental protection lies not only with the government and companies, but with every individual because the issue concerns us all. It is required of us to adopt a green way of life. That means we ought to be sparing in the use of water, electricity and other resources, and to reduce or even avoid the use of environmentally unfriendly products, inclusive of plastic shopping bags and disposables.

2. Describe the trend of studying abroad among Chinese students and analyze the reasons.
","More international students come to the United States than ever before. Home to the largest number of international students for eight years on end is the University of Southern California, attracting students from over 100 different places of origin around the world, especially those from India and China, with its strong academic programs. The students can interact with their American peers and learn about American life.

There has been a passion for studying abroad among Chinese students. Theirfavorite destinations are English-speaking countries. Some of them give up the chance of taking college entrance examination at home, and choose to apply for an undergraduate program overseas. Others try to pursue their further studies after finishing college in China.

The reasons for the surge of overseas study are quite apparent. What appeals most strongly to Chinese students is the quality education many foreign universities offer. Young people go abroad in the hope of having their competitive edge sharpened and securing themselves a brighter future. For lovers of English, Britain and the United Statesare no doubt ideal places where they can expose themselves tonative speakers ofEnglish.

* The opinions of those in the TV program about his speech

2. Give your comment on the speech.
","In the speech delivered by Barack Obama as the winner of the Nobel Prize for Peace, he was speaking forcefully in defense of war waged by America. According to him, the war is morally justified when fought to defend America from evil or to rescue an invaded country. ""War"" is the key word in his speech, which he used most frequently.

Obama's speech is well received among the three who join the TV program. In the first guest'sopinion, the president rose to the challenge and his speech would be well remembered.The second guestbelieves Obama was frank and honest in dealing with the difficult issues. The third guestthinks the president is willing to commit arms in conformity with the international law.

Personally speaking, I oppose the ideas put forth by Obama in his speech. War is dreadfully bloody and destructive no matter how it is whitewashed. As history has proved, every war started by America overseas in the name of upholding justice has rendered innocent victims and caused destruction beyond words. In fact, more rational alternatives, apart from war, can be sought out to resolve conflicts and preserve peace.

2. Give your suggestions on the precautions against an earthquake.
","A severe earthquake hit central Italy, killing nearly 300 people and leaving a thousand injured. A series of strong aftershocks have followed upon the heels of the earthquake, posing more difficulties for rescue efforts. People are forced to abandon their houses and stay either in tents or at hotels instead.

Rescue workers have responded remarkably well to the disaster. Adequate food, water and medicine are available. Patients can receive treatment in a field hospital. There is also psychological counseling to help the survivors get over the shock. Thanks to the extraordinary rescue services, people in the quake-stricken areabegin to come to terms with the reality.

Nevertheless, the work done prior to a disaster is, it seems to me, even more valuable than that after. Precautions against an earthquake demand collective efforts. The government, first of all, should channel funds into the construction of quake-resistant buildings in the earthquake-prone areas. Besides, scientists are expected to work harder toward a more accurate forecast. Meanwhile, the public need to be equipped with necessary survival skills through specialtraining programs.

","An accident of BP America sparked an explosion, causing a deep-sea oil well to burst in the Gulf region. The leaking oil was starting to affect the beaches in Florida. The chairman of the company expressed sorrow and regret for the incident. Yet its emergency response plans are inadequate.

President Obama will address the nation on the oil spill. He will illustrate the efforts his administration has taken to help clean up the oil,remedy the environment damage and reduce the economic impact on the locals to the minimum. He will also express the resolution of his administration to do everything in its power to tackle the disaster.

The incident provokes us into thinking. Some companies try to reap commercial profits at the expense of the environment. They have to be held responsible and pay ahigh price for their wrongful deeds. The penalty imposed upon them should be severe enough to alert them of their serious mistakes and to warn others against such deeds.

","Due tothe tremendous damage to the environment, most of the opencast coal mines were closed down, and many workers lost their jobs. Now, with care for the environment the left mines are extracted with advanced machines, and a new company has been created to clean up the damage caused by earlier mining, and it offers jobs to many former miners as well.

Which is the priority, economic development or environmental protection?

Some individuals argue that the answer should be economic development, because the environmental problems are inevitable and they are also the by-products of economic progress, which can be handled later when the money and time are adequate.

However, others hold the opposite opinion. Since serious environmental problems will threaten human living conditions and the earth, they, of course, should get more attention.

Actually, environmental protection and economic development can co-exist and stay in harmony. Our final aim is to provide a comfortable life for people. If we get it at the cost of environment, what is the point? So keeping the balance between environmental protection and economic development is of prior importance in guaranteeing us a better life.

2. Give your comments on the issue of education reform in Britain in terms of standards and centralization.
","In this report, a continuous strike of teachers in Britain made the education issues a greater concern of both the public and politicians. The Conservative Party proposed a radical education reform, which involvedthe following aspects.First of all,parental rightin choosing schools as they want should be increased so that good schools may beexpanded and bad schools may be shut down. Secondly, somepractical skills should be incorporated in school curriculum to enhance moreemployment chances for the students after their graduation.Thirdly,the powerof the local government should be reduced so that the central government would have better controlover educational standards.

However, these proposals metsomecriticisms. Some experts believed thatschool vouchers would not ensure the quality of educationand itwould be unfair to take power from local government secretly. Some people claimed what really mattered was the content of teaching that would influence young people's whole life.

In my view,practical skills should not be put into the curriculum since it will inevitably weaken the academic part of education. The job-related skills could be picked up laterduring work hours. As for the central control of educational standards, I think that is totally not necessary. Schools should have more say on the standards andthe curriculumto meet the local needs.

To survive in the fierce competition, traditional bookstores need to enhance their service in several aspects. Firstly, they'd better offer certain book discounts, which will be very attractive for readers. Then, they need to decrease their operating expenses so as to be more competitive in the market. In addition, it is reasonable to diversify their distribution channels to satisfy different customers. For example, they can also build their website to sell books online.

","A young foreignermanagedto takethe explosive to an airplane in the US. Luckily, no damaging results took place because he was stopped before the plane took off. Thisnews has aroused great concern among Americans who become increasingly worried about the overall situation about security in American airports.

People have proposed various measures to prevent such accidents from happening again, one of which is the use of full-body scanners in all airports for security check. Supporters claim that a full-body scanner can detect explosives and many dangerous things before passengers board the plane. However, some suspect full-body scanners may bring about safety and privacy problems to passengers. But experts believe that the correct use of these scanners won't do any harm to the people whogo throughthe security check.

Besides full-body scanners, I think other effective measures can be taken. First of all, more policemen and security staff can be deployed around the airport to detect suspects with dangerous things. What's more, dogs can be used to pick up the suspects and fight against criminals. In addition, materials publicizing flight security can be handed out to passengers to give them more common sense about safe flight travel. If all these can be carried out smoothly, the security situation in airports and air travelwill be improved to a great extent.

2. Give your comments on the theme of Solving the Problem of Energy Shortage.
","Energy shortage is a very serious problem in the world now. Many people worry that if we keep on using those fossil energy resources without any control, those resources on the earth will be exhausted soon. This of course will cause serious problems and even crisis and threaten the survival of mankind.

Most people agree that the problem can be solved in one way or another. One is to conserve and save our energy. For example, some countries have a daylight saving system to use less electricity for lighting during daytime. Some have enforced serious penalties on the overuse of electricity, water, and farming land. By these means, people hope the drain on energy resources could be slowed down.

However, conservation alone cannot solve the problem. Another effective way is to develop new energy resources. There are many other energy resources that we can develop such as nuclear power, waterpower and solar power. Those energy resources can be recycled and reused and thus helping our society develop in a sustainable way.

Actually, many countries' governments have realized the problem of energy shortage and began to think of ways of solving it. Some international conferences are also held in order to get some agreements and cooperation among different countries. However, not all the governments turn to be very cooperative in this process, especially when a sustainable way of living may reduce the financial profits they make. So there is still a long way to go if we want to solve the problem. But there is no doubt that those developed countries should take more responsibilities. Anyway, if all the above guidelines can be strictly followed by all governments and every ordinary person, I believe, we can solve the problem of energy shortage in the end.

People can help in whatever way they like, such as, literacy, the environment, AIDS, seniors, animals, veterans, and women's issues. It's a meaningful experience for the participants andthey are having a good time helping build a garden ina local school.

Volunteer work is significant to the morals of society, which encourage lovefor others and selflessness in helping others. For example, the garden in the news being built in a school by volunteersmay contribute to the local education. If a society can value volunteer work more than materialism, people willwarm-heartedly help others andfriendly communities will be built, and hence a harmonious society.

In China, more and more people are aware of the value of volunteer work and participate as well. Afterthe earthquake in Sichuan, a large number of volunteers went to Wenchuan to give a helping hand. Those volunteers were so devoted and made a lot of sacrifice to save others' lives and to help the desperate people there, which moved me to tears when I saw the related news through media.

In this news item, three representatives from different political parties had a televised debate for the position of British Prime Minister.

As far as I am concerned, televised political debate is a good way for voters to get to know about the candidates and helps them to choose the appropriate leader. In recent years, although there is no live TV political debate on the national level in China, there are some live TV election on the local level in some places. And both Chinese politicians and people are dealing with it with great cautiondue to the uniquesituations in China.

Of course, although televised political debate sounds nice, it may also bear some problems. Some candidates may talk big and give personal attack to their opponents in the debate to win votes. But after they get elected, they may not keep their promises.

","According to a new study by Japanese researchers, the eating of rice may well reduce the chances of heart attacks. Of course, this is a piece of good news for all people. However, the traditional Japanese diet full of fish and rice is losing popularity in Japan, especially among youngsters because of the introduction of western food.
Therefore, there is always a contradiction between taste and health when we are eating. However, we must make efforts to keep a healthy diet in order to keep fit. Firstly, we should have more fresh vegetable and fruit in our daily diet. Secondly, we should follow the Japanese researchers’ advice to have rice for every meal. Last but not the least, it is of vital significance to have a routine eating habit, such as never eating anything late in the night.
Although it is extremely difficult to follow the above suggestions and resist the temptation of some delicious but unhealthy food, we should at least make a balance between what we eat and our health.

","Thirty years ago, Livigno was an undeveloped agricultural area. In summer, people used to climb the mountains to look after the animals and they had to collect wood for the winter. When winter came, they only had contact with Switzerland by horse. At that time, there was no radio or records in their home, not to mention television. Therefore, they were total strangers to the outside world.

However, 30 years later, Livigno, the previous tiny remote agricultural settlement, has transformed into one of Europe's most popular ski resorts. Influenced by the tourist boom, the people are no longer the innocent farmers. Some of them have becomeowners of hotels, souvenir shops or music stores. People's current life has changed totally.

All these fantastic changes should be attributed to the growth in Livigno. In one generation, Livigno has grown from a small farming settlement in the Alps to one of Italy's top ski resorts. This was all the benefit brought bya new road. From the development of Livigno, we may draw a conclusion that no matter the natural condition in one area is good or bad, exploring its superiority in strength can produce remarkable development.

Jay Leno, as a prominenthost of NBC, hosted a comic show and won the popularity from the audience. But when Conan, another famous host expressed his intention to leave the network, things changed. The executive of the company came straight to Jay's office, and told him to leave the network and the show he loved so much. It broke his heart, as he knew his program was still number one at that very moment. And the only explanationcould only be that the company was trying to cater to Conan's ambition. Five years later, Jay was invited back to the network to launch a big TV show, and fortunately he made it popular as before. Dissatisfied with the time arrangement of his program, Conan eventually left the company by accepting $45 million. And finally, the war of words between the two ended.

Two lessons can be drawn in Jay's case. First, no company will offer free lunch. The executives makeevery decision for the interest of the company. In order to survive in the rat race, especially in contemporary society, we have to make ourselves well prepared for our job. Second, we do need patience and prudence in bad time of our life.

With her foot being sucked into the gap between the step and the side panel, the little girl suffered a series of surgeries.According to the report, many escalator users don't follow experts' suggestion to check it twice a year and there is no federal regulation on escalator inspection. What's worse, several escalators in public areas have great potential defects such as a hole between steps, loose side panel or gaps larger than a pencil tip, which will cause disasters to passengers.

When the flesh contends against cold machines, it is human beings that always are the victims. Therefore, the government should not shed off the responsibility to protect its tax payers, especially when they use the public facilities. Firstly, on the legislative level, the government should work out a series of national laws on escalator manufacture, safety standard, daily maintenance and regular inspection. Under strict guidance and requirements, people could tackle the potential danger beforehand. Besides, the passengers should pay enough attention to the moving escalators when they step on it. If there are kids, thehandicapped or the aged on the escalators, other passengers should pay special attention to them. Lastly, there should be enough eye-catching warning boards on, along and around escalators to remind the passengers in case of some unexpected mechanical or electrical breakdown. Only by working together can such escalator-related accidents be reduced to zero-happening.

In my opinion, one should take the disabled people as any other people and assume nothing about their disability. The disabled people are just common but valid people worthy of your respect and care. I just give my suggestions as follows:

Firstly, when greeting a disabled person, you can just smile or offer a spoken greeting. Sometimes a handshake is appropriate, too. Secondly, when talking with a disabled person, try to avoid mentioning his disability and always look directly at him during your conversation. When talking with those who have speech disabilities, you should be patient and pay attention to what they are saying. Do not pretend to understand when you don't. You should politely ask them to repeat what they said. If necessary, you can offer them pen and paper and try to explain the difficulty in your conversation. Last but not the least, when you offer assistance to the disabled, you should wait patiently until it is accepted.

2.Express your idea on the theme of Why Do People Volunteer.
","A retired government worker owns the 26 hectares of land, but he leases it to the Volunteer Farm for $1 a year, on which fresh food is being harvested to feed the hungry. On the Volunteer Farm, a manager and a volunteer coordinator are the only paid staff. As its name suggests, the farm relies on volunteers to weed, plant and harvest.

In my opinion, people volunteer mainly for the following reasons. First, they are enthusiastic about something which can do good for others in need. Second, they are grateful for life and they would like to give something back to the society they live in. Third, through volunteer work, skills and experience in a certain field can be gained and a sense of recognition can be achieved. Last but not least, volunteer work is beneficial for one’s growth and many a time, can help people find lifelong friendship. All in all, volunteer work gives people a sense of accomplishment.

*

What the scheme is all about, why it is started

*

What the two speakers think of it

2. Give your comments on whether any individual effort by either a person or an organization can make a difference in protecting our environment.
","The scheme talked about in the conversation is started by a new Copenhagen hotel in its opening business, which says that any cyclist who can cycle for roughly 15 minutes to power several light bulbs can get a free main course. This is really unusual and can be easily misunderstood as a publicity act, which is exactly what one of the speakers originally believed. Later on, as we listen on, we are told that this brilliant idea is really out of the hotel's environmental concerns in the larger part with a side-effect of free advertising as well.

At this point, I can't help wondering whether it can serve its primary purpose considering that it is just a temporary and ""minimal"" effort made by a singleorganization. Doubts of this kind are not uncommon nowadays. We often ask ourselves, ""What's the use of it if I am the only one who do this, be it to keep a place clean, to protect our environment or to save energy?"" However, on second thoughts, we would answer the doubt with a definite ""yes"" as a truth unfolds itself plainly before our eyes: If no one takes the initiative, no awareness will be aroused, which in turn will lead to an overwhelmingly passive society. If that does happen, I think our days on the Earth are numbered.

Meanwhile, we read countless stories of great social changes triggered by an individual although the impact was limited at that time. The story of Ruby Bridges who helped end segregation in the United States can be read in some history books. And recently, Charlie Simpson, a seven-year-old boy who hoped to raise £500 for Haiti earthquake relief by cycling five miles around a local park has raised £120,000 in donations and gift aid, with the total still rising.

I firmly believe the same can be applied in the case of environmental protection. More and more people like Ruby and Charlie will stand up to live by the same belief and contribute to protecting our environment. Later, with our joined hands, we are sure to live in a better world.

"1.Write a short summary of the news item about accelerated glacier melt.

2. Analyze the reason for the accelerated glacier melt.
","Scientists in Greenland are warning about accelerated glacier melt. Several years ago, the Greenland glaciers were reported to accelerate melting. The melting speed of one glacier accelerated so fast that it doubled within two years. Now, the acceleration has slowed down, but a scientist warns that people should still be cautious about a collapse of Greenland's ice sheet.

The accelerated glacier melt is an inevitable result of global warming. Glaciers are like ""rivers of ice."" When the ice meets the sea it either melts, breaks away into the ocean as icebergs, or feeds into the ice shelf. Under stable environmental conditions there exists a balance in which ice that melts into the sea is continually replaced by the ice newly formed on the ice sheet. However, global warming has caused this balance to be disturbed. The amount of ice melting into the sea is larger than the amount of ice newly formed. Thus glaciers are melting faster and faster.

","The way that one walks is as unique as his fingerprints. One's gait also is a part of his identity, and the individuality of gait is harder to mask.

A British University has developed a new security system that can identify individuals by the way they walk.At the university, Mark and his research team analyzed the different ways people walk. They used an equation to describe human motion, and the deviation of each body joint from a standard motion gives each individual a gait signature. The team is refining their techniques to deal with real-life situation, and the recognition success rate is 100% so far. This invention will make the job of the security men and the police much easier.

Similar to diseases, crime prevention is better than cure.To prevent crime and keep our society safe, everyone should be part of it. Here are some tips on how to protect your house from being the target of thieves. Firstly, you should close all the windows when you are out. Secondly, do not leave any notes on your door for possible visiting friends or the delivery man. Thirdly, replace any window or door lock immediately when it is in need of repair. Fourthly, if you are out of home for several days, it is necessary to ask your neighbors to keep an eye on your house. And most importantly, keep alert and when there is a suspicious problem, call the police at once.

Why isit more difficult for foreigners to secure a job in America? That's because they don't know how to communicate with the native interviewers. As you know, in different countries, there are different communicative customs. For example, in China, the employers like the employees to be hard-working and quiet, and they want the interviewees to speak only when they want them to; in Africa, people, especiallywomen, don't chat with strangers; In Russia, the interviewees are supposed to be honest, modest and seriouswhile smilingis inappropriate. However, in the United States, things are different. The interviewees should learn to smile,to chat with strangers,and to ask questions, rather thanjust keep quiet.

","Illegal Downloading

A report says that there are millions of people downloading illegally in the UK. By downloading illegally, people can easily get free access to materials worth billions. So the report suggests that the government should pay attention to consumers' attitudes to illegal downloading since it may infringe on the copyright of some works. But it also points out that simply punishing downloaders may cost a lot but earn little.

Actually, with the popularization of the Internet, illegal downloading has become a worldwide problem. Getting free materials from the Internet may be one of the most common things that lots of netizens do every day. Some people from the creative industries believe that illegal downloading will definitely hinder innovation and threaten the long-term health of the business. And illegal downloading, which can be comparedto stealing, should be punished by law. However, others don't think so. Some netizens believe that the soul of the Internet is sharing. Besides, there is no sound evidence that file-sharing has negative effects on product selling.

People may hold different ideas, but it is obvious that illegal downloading will do no good to the copyright owners. We can't just get something from others for free without the owner's permission even if it is not something concrete with shape. Reasonable people agree that copyright owners should be paid for their work. However, justas the report says, simply calling every downloader a criminal may be a very bad idea. Besides making some legislation, we need toenhance the copyright protection consciousness of the netizens. And self-disciplinemay be the best option in this field.

There are many reasons accounting for species extinction, a lot of which may be attributed to human activities. In the first place, as is mentioned in the audio clip, climate change, and the ""green house effect"" in particular, should assume the primary responsibility, which in turn is caused by too much carbon dioxideemission from industrial production and private cars. In the second place, over-hunting and over-fishing have directly led to the extinction of some species;too much de-forestation or over-development may result in the loss of some species' habitat, which is the foundation of the survival of all species.

I think, if it is dealt with in a serious manner, internship is very important for college graduates. Undoubtedly, it is part of one's college education.Its purpose is to prepare college students for their future life in society. For example, during internship, one has to learn to get on well with others in a workplace and tocopewithdifferent tasks. College students can also take this as the first step of making the transition from being a student to a full-time worker mentally. What is more, some interns are even able to land a satisfactory job when they leave their temporary workplace because they have impressed the bosses with their amazing performance or immense potential during their short stay.

A well-known proverb goes like ""No pains, No gains."" If we take internship seriously, we can definitely benefit from it. After all, it is a new yet rewarding adventure of college students in society.

It was certain she was going to learn from this business failure in the future.

Ruth's experience naturally rings a bell in my mind as university students in China now are encouraged to start their own undertakings with many favorable preferential policies from the state, be they fresh graduates or in-school undergraduates. It is apparent that the self-employment of college students is attributed to many factors, fierce competition in job markets, efforts in putting theory into practice, developing innovative minds, to name just a few.Personally, I seem tohave a divided opinion on those two differentgroups ofuniversity students in question.

The hidden reason behind this is not hard to analyze as there’s a growing awareness for the authorities regarding the urgency of popularization of culture, knowledge and history with every average person in our society. Only with free access to this live ‘database’, can most people fully enjoy what museums could offer to them. However, free admission to museums might lead to some social problems as well. The most obvious problem is that it might give museums a very heavy economic burden which directly impedes the sustainable development of these organizations. As a result, our government has to work out other ways to collect funds from different channels, which might be difficult to operate or control. On the other hand, free admission attracts too many visitors, some of which might not be well-purposed and do some conscious or unconscious damage to the valuable treasures which used to be well-preserved in the museums. As a university student, I am in favor of the free-admission conduct. Yet it is proposed that some measures should be taken to solve the potential problems caused by it. For example, museums can make some regulations to guide the behavior of visitors or set some ‘closed’ days for museums for regular maintenance. Only in this way can free-admission to museums become a long-lasting phenomenon and have sustainable development.

Electricity has become an essential part of our modern life. The most obvious examples are electric lamps that give us light at night, TV and radio that entertain us everyday. In addition, electricity is essential for many household appliances such as air conditioners, refrigerators and microwave ovens.

If there were no power, our world would be in a state of confusion.

Secondly, we would have to do without convenient industrial products, and a lot of time and labors would be wasted. Last but not least, surgeons could not save as many lives without electricity-driving computers and medical machines.

Therefore, we should do everything to guarantee a steady supply of power. On the one hand, we should cultivate a sense of saving electricity. On the other hand, more power stations are needed and other energy resources must be found to cater for the increasing demand for electricity.

","","Online Shopping

In recent years, online shopping is becoming increasingly popular in China, especially among young people. It seems that everything, ranging from clothes to home appliances, can be easily bought from online shops.

People's enthusiasm in online shopping can be attributed to many reasons. First of all, it is more convenient for people to choose products they need online than in real shops because they do not need to go out of their homes. Secondly, products in online shops are always cheaper because of the relatively low operating costs. Lastly, people can compare quite a lot of similar products just by clicking the mouse before they make their decisions.

With the popularity of online shopping, some people wonder whether online shops will replace real shops. As far as I'm concerned, although online shopping has so many advantages, it also has disadvantages in that it lacks the atmosphere of appreciating real products in real shops. Therefore, online shopping and in-store shopping will coexist in modern society.

For example, people will be annoyed by the noise the barking dog makes at midnight. The worst of all, people's health will be endangered if they are bitten by dogs with pathogenic bacteria.

However, some people are for keeping pets. They maintain that pets can keepthem company. In particular, pets can bring happiness to the elderlywho live alone. What's more, it can arouse pets keepers' curiosity to learn more knowledge about animals if the pets are unique and particular, such as snakes, lizards, dogsand so on.

Foreign languages are good tools for them to make friends and learn different cultures.

Though learning a foreign language requires many efforts, I won't trade it for anything. The most wonderful result of learning a foreign language is that I can communicate with more people thanI could before. It enables me to meet new people,start conversations, anddevelop new friendship. Besides, learning another language gives me insights into another culture. It opens my mind to new ways of seeing things. And I believe along with the global development, more and more Chinese may go abroadandmore foreigners will come to China, so it'll be very necessary for us to learn some foreign languages.

What we learn as our major at college determines what kind of job we are to take after graduation to a great extent.

Some students, before entering the college, start to think about their job prospects. They are strong-minded and purposeful. They have a thorough knowledge about themselves: they know the relative strengths and weaknesses of their personality; they know their interests and specialties. With a right choice of a satisfactory major, they are making steady progress to their potential career at college.

Some students, however, are not as decisive as the above ones. They are confused about their future jobs. Blindly, they choose their major, but quickly lose the interest in pursuing it or find it unsuitable for themselves. They spend the whole college period doing nothing but complaining and regretting.

In my opinion, it is essential for students to make a right choice of major before they start their college study. Both schools and parents have to take the responsibility of cultivating youngsters' sense of career planning and sense of independence. Only in this way, can college life be a happy and beneficial experience for more students.

With more and more people having their private cars, traffic problems have increasingly caused great concern, and among them, drunk driving is the most destructive and serious problem. From media, we often hear news of death and casualty caused by drunk driving.

Why are there so many drunk drivers on the road? This has a lot to do with our longcherished drinking culture in China. People think drinking would promote relationship and create arelaxing atmosphere. Families and friends may propose a toast on special occasions, and business people also regard drinking as a necessary means to communicate with their clients. Even if you can't drink, you need to drink to give your business partner face and respect, and alsoshow him that you are honest and trustworthing by putting your life on the line and drinking more thanyou are capable of.As a result, so many drinkers are produced in this subculture. Besides, the regulations against drunk driving in China are not as strict as they should be. Even if someone was killed because of drunk driving, the driver would not be punished severely. Therefore, lack of legal protection for pedestrians and indifferenceofdrivers worsen the problem.

Actions need to be taken immediately to stop drunk driving. First, not only government but alsocommon people should have zero tolerance for it. Strict laws need to be established to punish drunk drivers. Second, drivers themselves should be educated so that they are aware of the serious consequences of drunk driving and refuse to drive after drinking alcohol. Only in this way can we reduce or eliminate tragedies on road.

It is reported that 840,000 students, which accounts for 10 percentof the high school graduates in China, spurned the College Entrance Examination in 2009. People from all walks of life doubt why they skip the most representative and standard examination in China, and give up the most important channel to change their whole life.

There are several reasons for this phenomenon. On the one hand, some students don't think that college entrance examination is the only way to receive higher education. They prefer to go abroad to continue their study. Others hold the view that four-year hard work and study may not guarantee them a satisfying job after graduation. On the other hand, students from rural areas feel it's hard for their families to afford the high tuition fees, so they often choose to drop out and bring home the bacon. In addition, the present employment issue is one of the critical factor for high school graduates to skip the College Entrance Examination.

As far as I am concerned, the phenomenon is a reflection ofthe change of traditional attitudes toward college education: It is not the only way to success. As the old saying goes: ""All roads lead to Rome."" High school graduates can choose to learn some skills in technical institutes to be well-paid blue-collar workers in the future, which is also a good way for them to achieve success.

Job hunting has always been a headache for college students. Though many graduates are employed right after graduation, some are not. Most serious of all, some still have no idea where to go working even a long time after graduation.

The reasons for this phenomenon are various. On the one hand, a few years ago colleges and universities enrolled so many students in popular majors, such as economy, finance and so on that the number of graduates was greater than the need in the market. On the other hand, most graduates would rather stay in large cities without suitable job to do than go to the country.

I reckon this problem can be solved if both colleges and students take measures. First, they should research the market and develop special skills to suit its need. Second, students' attitude towards employment should be changed. They should go to small cities and country. There they can also give full play to their professional knowledge. In a word, if we pay much attention, the situation can be improved.

More and more people shop online for clothing, shoes, CDs and so on, because it is convenient. I believe this is a bad development. The reasons are as follows.

While shopping online grows, shopping in stores declines. Therefore, stores may have to close down and their employees get laid off. People who favor online shopping claim that it will create more jobs in the delivery of goods and information technology. However, there will be much fewer jobs available in those areas for all the affected shopkeepers and shop assistants. Other major disadvantages of shopping online are the lack of security and cause problems for undisciplined shoppers. The security issue is most vital. You do not know if you can trust the website you visit and even if it is trustworthy, hackers may still steal your credit card information. Since the online stores are open 24 hours a day and 7 days a week,people can buy new goods anytime, which is especially harmful for those shoppers who lack self-discipline.

To sum up, shopping online may be a great development for some people, but it presents considerable potential disadvantages, such as job losses, insecurity and overshopping for people lacking self-discipline. All aspects considered, online shopping looks like a bad trend to me.

Different generations tend to have different states of mind as well as life experiences, and the quick pace of current society makes this situation worse. As a result, there exists a generation gap between the old and the young. How to bridge the generation gap?

I believe that the solution to the generation gap is communication. First of all, young people have much to learn from the older generation. Older people have more life experience to share with the young generation. Currently, many young people are unwilling to listen to the counsel of the elderly because their suggestions are often viewed as old-fashioned and out of date. However, it is not appropriate for the young to do so since the old can offer them helpful suggestions on how to live a successful life. Secondly, old people have much to learn from the younger generation. Young people are energetic and ambitious, so they know the modern world very well. They may not have the wisdom of years, but their knowledge and dynamics are no less important. The elderly need to learn from the young how to work with modern technology and they can understand young people by communicating with them.

If both the older and younger generations are open to communication and are willing to listen to each other, we can get the best of both wisdom and modernity.

Some universities provide students with televisions in their dorms and I think that this growing trend should be encouraged.

The reasons are as follows: First, it encourages students to socialize. They can gather in the dormitory, watch some programs and discuss what they have been watching. This helps to bind together the roommates who have never met before college and to create a friendly and harmonious environment. Second, it enables students to keep up with current domestic and world affairs. It is all too easy for students to become confined to their own little world of campus life, unaware of the outside world. Foreign teachers often say that Chinese students do not have a sufficient grasp of current world affairs and lack alternative viewpoints.

One reason why a class should have students as its focus is that it encourages them to do research on the subject and to do the assignments actively rather than passively. A student-centered class has the advantage of promoting creative acts and original thinking. Another reason is that most activities of student-centered classes are based on students' needs, such as group discussion and debate on certain topics. Therefore, students can express their opinions and perspectives about the topics, which can broaden their vision and promote discussions.

A television plays an important role in the life of a modern family. As an effective way to relieve peopleof their strain and stress, the television brings us relaxation and entertainment. But for all its benefits, it also has an adverse effect on our family ties.

The television tends toinfluence family members to communicate normally and contact closely. As a lot of families can afford more than one television set, it is often the case that the family members watch different programs of their interests in separate rooms and ignore others. Even if all the family members gather together in front of the same TV set, their attentions are distracted by TV programs. What's more, they may quarrel over which channel to choose.

Something must be done to solve the problem. It is essential that people shouldspend less time watching TVand more timecommunicating with their family members. Besides, they can make wise use of TV viewing to strengthen their relationships. They can, for instance, discuss the same program and voice different opinions or try to seek some common grounds.

Nowadays it is difficult for college graduates to find a job. Many college students say that they are out of job even before graduation. That is, when they finish their collegethey cannot get themselves employed．

There are various reasons for college graduates' unemployment. First of all, today's job market is becomingincreasingly competitive. Withthe expansion of college enrolment, a large number of graduates flood into the job market every year, which makes the competition for employment even more fierce. Meanwhile, graduates are heavily biased against certain jobs. They have no interest in working in small cities or remote areas.Nor do theyintendto get employed in the basic sectors like agriculture. Another reason is that many employers favor experienced workers over fresh graduates.

Some efforts can be made to improve the employment situation of college graduates. Government should raise the wage levels in small cities or remote areas to attract graduates to work there. Meanwhile, companies can offerthe newly graduatedsome pre-job training to help them becomequalified for job vacancies. Mostimportant ofall,colleges should helptheir students form aright idea aboutjob-seeking through education.With all these efforts, the employment rate of college graduates will hopefully be increased.

College students are allowed to marry when they reach the legal age, but it is unrealistic to do so because the necessary conditions are still not mature, and marriage may bring about more problems than expected.

The worries that come along with marriage are far more than the joys. First of all, students have no steady income and the majority of them are financially dependent upon their parents. Therefore, they are unable toassume the responsibility of a married person. Besides, students have a lot of academic work to do. Marriage will distract their attention and interfere with their studies even if they don't have babies. Moreover, there is no telling thecouples can find employment in the same city upon graduation. There is a long way to go between love and marriage. The obstacles to overcome may well prove their marriage to be a decision without much consideration.

The premature flower of marriage will bear bitter fruit. To conclude, it is unwise for college students to enter into marriage, which will probably tie them down. They ought to take acautious attitude toward marriageas there aremany unpredictable problems that need time and patience to be solved.

I used to learn the materials mechanically in high school. I followed the teachers' instructions strictly and learned under the close supervision of both my parents and teachers. Moreover, I learned under pressure and had endless homework to do and lots of tests to take.

Now at college, learning is independent and self-directed. Self-discipline is of vital importance to a college student. I am learning in a relaxed and tolerant atmosphere, but I have to learn on my own initiative, explore and make judgmentsby myself. Furthermore, learning is not confined to textbooks; more knowledge is expected to be acquired in the library, via the Internet, from club activities, or through internships.

For a number of families, keeping pets has become part of their lives. They regard pets as their faithful companions that bring them a lot of joy and comfort. According to pet keepers, there are some advantages of keeping pets. It can help relieve pressure and depression adults face and bring out humanity in children. Pets are emotionally important to patients, the elderly and those living alone. However, quite some people oppose keeping pets on grounds that pets are annoying to others.

The opponents argue, firstly, that running around on the loose, pet dogs and cats leave droppings on the grass and in the streets, and ruin the public surroundings. Secondly, as often happens, pets may scare or even attack people, so they are a potential threat to the public. The opponents also point out that pets may spread disease-causing bacteria.

In my point of view, keeping pets is not merely a personal matter. The keepers are expected to be community-minded and socially responsible. Outdoors they should hold their pets in leash and take care to keep them at some distance from people. They should also clean up the mess made by their pets. In short, keeping pets is agreeable only when the keepers see to it that their pets don't annoy the public.

With the development of science and technology, people have become increasinglyaware of the necessity of using mobile phones. Even students on campus begin to use mobile phones and view them as a must. The following are my points of view.

Mobile phones, on the one hand, are beneficial to students. To begin with,they enablestudents to keep in touch with their parents and friends more conveniently and quickly.

Second,they may distractstudents from their study, which does harm to theirfuture. Third,they sometimes become a nuisance especially whenthey are brought into class orthe library, which disturbs the teacher and other students.

As far as I am concerned, it is not good for students to use mobile phones, especially for those elementary and middle school students, since their main task is to study.In my opinion, universities should make some rules to discourage studentsfromusing mobile phones on campus. Moreover, parents may also forbid their children to take mobile phones to school.

When I travel with a companion, I have someone with whom to share what I experience. We can talk over the day's events and discoveries, and this will make them more interesting. In addition, it is often comforting to have a familiar person around when we are in a strange environment. When I am traveling in a foreign country, I may be unable to speak the language or may be confused by the local customs. With a travel companion, I will always have someone to talk and share my feelings with. Finally, a travel companion can make the journey easier and safer. We can help each other to take care of our belongings and get information, as well as keep each other company while waiting in long lines.

"My Favorite Place to visit 1. 我最喜爱的地方是… 2. 我喜欢这里的原因是…
","","","My Favorite Place to visit Do you have a favorite place to go—a place with family, good weather, and fun things to do like crabbing? I’m glad I do. New Jersey is my favorite place for many reasons. The first reason is my family. Over half of my family lives in New Jersey. When I visit, my cousins and I laugh and play all day and night. My uncles and aunts take me to the boardwalk where we ride tall, long roller coasters. We devour juicy caramel-covered apples and foot-long hot dogs. My family is fun to be with. The second reason for New Jersey being my favorite place is the weather. Instead of being hot and sweaty, it’s always cool and moist. When I think about my visits, I can just feel the crisp fall breeze in my hair. I can just see the white, fluffy winter snow. I can just hear the soft spring trickles of rain splashing on the sidewalks. I can just feel the warm summer sun on my face. The weather is great! The third reason for New Jersey being my favorite place is crabbing. If it’s crab season, we crab. Sometimes we catch crabs on hooks, and sometimes we lower crab cages into the bay. Then we pull them out later. One time my brother caught a crab so big that it got stuck in the crab cage! The crab finally got out, but it hurt one of its legs and broke the cage trying. For all these reasons, New Jersey is my favorite place to go. If you don’t have a favorite place, I think you should search for one. It’s good to visit a favorite place—a place where you can make special memories.

"Should We Give Up Practicing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)?

3. 你的观点
","","","Whether we should preserve Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) or not has aroused heated debate recently. Many people oppose to TCM and believe that there is no evidence to prove its effectiveness to treat diseases. Therefore they claim that TCM is not scientific. They prefer to use Western medicine. Some people even call for abolishing TCM. From their view, Western medicine is based on standardized testing but Traditional Chinese medicine is not clinically tested. On the other hand, those who favor TCM believe that it is the accumulation of experiences. Itcan treat many fatal diseases that cannot be cured with Western medicine. Based on the advantages and significances of TCM above, the Chinese government also attaches great importance to TCM. Now there are a lot of TCM hospitals in the country. In my opinion, TCM is indispensible in the domain of medicine. Although patients can be cured by western medicine more quickly, they should pay more attention to the side effect of the tablets in western medicine. In contrast, herbs are much safer. In addition, TCM cures diseases in essence rather than only in symptoms. In a word, we should cherish our significant heritage of TCM, make good use of it and develop it for the better.

Nowadays it's becoming more and more common for ordinary people to travel by air. Some people spend much time flying in the 8000-meter-high sky every year. There are both advantages and disadvantages of traveling by air.

Being fast and comfortable are probably the two major advantages of air travel. Airliners can take you to any place you want to go to fast. Undoubtedly, this is the main reason why people choose to travel by air instead of other means of transportation. What's more, it's rather comfortable to travel by air. People can enjoy the wonderful services aboard and the beautiful air hostesses can make your travel more enjoyable. The disadvantages are as obvious as the advantages. Maybe the biggest disadvantage is that it is too expensive compared with other means of transportation like buses and trains, which prevents many travelers from choosing air travel. Besides, it is much more dangerous to travel by air than by bus or by train. Once there is something wrong with the airplane you take, the chances for you to survive are really slim.

However, in my opinion, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. We cannot deny that the airplanes do bring us a lot of conveniences although they are sometimes considered less safe by some people.

According to a survey, the employment rate of college graduates has been declining from 80 percent in 2002 to 70 percent in 2008 and the job hunting situation is getting worse than ever before. There are several factors contributing to this situation. To begin with, the ever-growing rate of college enrollment has produced a huge army of graduates every year, which exerts great pressure on the job market. Another reason is that many graduates insist on finding a comfortable job with good salary, otherwise they would rather stay unemployed. What is more, college students have rare opportunities to put what they have learned into practice and their lack of working experience, to some extent, leads to the failure in hunting jobs. Solution to the problem requires efforts from both the society and the students. On one hand, our government is advised to provide favorable policies to help graduates start a business on their own or become self-employed. On the other hand, college students should change their idea about employment and be down-to-earth in hunting jobs.

Can anyone live without food? Of course not. But do you know whether what you are eating is healthy to you? Maybe you can not besure about it because food safety has become an increasingly serious problem. It is often disclosed in various media that this food contains something poisonous or that food has something deadly. Sometimes we may get lost about what on earth we can eat safely.

What harmswill thisproblem bring about? Primarily,unsafe foodis harmful to our health. Many children have died from theproblematic milk and many people get sick because of harmful chemicals added to food. That makes families suffer a lot from unsafe food. Some people get seriously sick, which is a great burden to their family members. What is worse, many families are even broken as a result of the death of a family member. Last but not least, if this issue gets worse, it will make us lose confidence in society and other people. Too many food problems may make us feel that society is so dangerous and people are so evil thatmutual trust will be gone. How terribleit willbe!

I think the key solution tothis problemis that strict laws and regulations are made to supervise enterprisesand individuals. If anyone makes any mistake related to food, he or she should be fined heavily so that others will not follow suit. On the other hand, people should also learn to use laws to protect their own rights. I believe that only in these ways can we reduce food problems.

All in all, food safety is a social problem that wecan not ignore any longer. We have to take actions to avoid food problems, so that we can eat without any worry.

At the thought of losing the wallet, which contained my ID card, two bank cards and 300 yuan, I was so depressed. The next morning, when I was about to report the loss of my cards, one student came to my dormitory and asked whether I had lost my wallet. After describing it precisely, I recovered my wallet. I was so thankful that I intended to reward him, but he only said ""Don't mention it"" and then left, even without letting on his name.

Therefore, I'd like to take this chance to show my gratitude to the student through our university newspaper. He picked up my wallet and instantly returned it.

Also, I'd like to advocate such honesty and reliability. Not only I but also everyone else is expected to perceive him as our role model.

Last but not least, some students do not want to do the basic work in a company; they hope to start their career at a high position as a manager and earn more money.

As far as I am concerned,the whole society should do something to change this situation.First, college students should change their attitudes towards jobs. Second, universities should organize lectures about how to choose a suitable job. Third, companies should provide the graduates with some intern opportunities. These efforts will undoubtedly enable students to find satisfactory jobs.

","","Free Admission to Museums?

Nowadays, more and more museums open freely to visitors both home and abroad. The purpose of this practice obviously is to educate the public, to provide more opportunities for citizens to get easy access to the world of history, culture and knowledge.

Although free admission to museums has distinct advantages, there are still arguments that it may also bring harmful effects. Firstly, those valuable cultural relics conserved in the museums may be damaged or destroyed consciously or unconsciously by the visitors. Secondly, it could do a great damage to the environment and the facilities of the museums, as more people visiting means more litter and more equipment usage. Thirdly, free of charges result in huge economic burden on the operation of the museums.

As far as I'm concerned, free admission to museums is of huge significance. More people get the opportunity to enlarge their knowledge. However, measures should be taken to educate the public to observe the rules and regulations when visiting the museums or even strict laws may be needed to protect the museums.

It is quite common that many college students now take part-time jobs in their spare time. However, there is still a controversy about whether it is good or not. Some people think that taking a part-time job certainly brings some benefits to students.

In the first place, it is good and effective for college students to get to know the society and learn how to get along with different kinds of people. What's more, taking a part-time job provides students with a golden opportunity to get some work experience, whichwill make them more competitive in the job market in the future. Finally, students can make some money, which can help to lessen their families' financial burdens.

Of course, there are also some problems arising from students' taking part-time jobs. First, some students may spend too much time on their part-time jobs, then neglect their studies. Second, some students may be cheated by others since they are not mature enough to make correct judgments.

As for me, I hold the view that college students need to have more access to the outside world.However,they should balance theirsocial practicesand academic studies. After all, they should know what their main task is.

Nowadays, some college students are fit physically but not mentally. Some students are frequently in low spirits. Some others even suffer from mental illnesses like depression. Their daily life and study arethereforeseverely affected.

There are a few factors that contribute to this situation. Firstly, some students are under great stress. The stress may come from competition with their classmates. While in high school, they were probably top students. However, after entering the university, they find they are merely average students inclass. They simply can't accept the fact that they are not outstanding any longer. Secondly, some students from poor families are under financial pressure as well. Even though some ofthem are grantedloansto cover theirtuition,they still have to struggle with financial difficulties. Thirdly, some students are not sociable. They have no friends whatsoever on campus. Therefore, when they run into trouble in either life or study, they have no one to talk to.

As the society progresses, huge changes have hit thetelevision industrywith continually rising of various entertainment programs. With a TV remote controller at hand, people nowadays have more choices than ever before.

The boom of entertainment programs surely animates people's dailylife. By amusing them with laughter, jokes and attractive performances, those new types of entertainment programs bring lots of fun to people and fill a certain need for those who want a relaxation after work. Besides, some kind of programs also enrich people's knowledge by drawing them into fierce competitions.

However, while entertainment programs grow at an impressive rate, they are far from perfect. One big problem is thatthe majorityof those entertainment programsare only a pure imitation of the existing ones. The rapid increase in dating programs is a good example. Many local TV channels now have launched their own dating programs since the success of If You Are the One. Though changes are made in those newly-launched local dating programs from their forms to their operation, it is still just like to put old wine in a new bottle. What's more, some entertainment programs are also assaulted by some people for their vulgarity. Take thetalent program for instance. In thetalent program, players are originally supposed to show their best performance to the judges. But some players go against this intent by dressing weird clothes and behaving weirdly for the purpose of winning.

Because of those problems, entertainment programs now are losing their ground. Some programs are even forced to shut down instead of going far. In order to promise a better future for entertainment programs, everyone is to be a part of relevant issues. For the government, corresponding rules should be made to regulate those entertainment programs. For the audience, they should hold a better understanding of what an entertainment program is and refuse those which are not. Only in this way can entertainment programs have a better future.

First of all, a part-time job takes up much spare time. College students have challenging learning goals to achieve. Part-time jobs will occupy their timeof previewing and reviewing their courses, orcompleting their assignments. In this sense, part-time jobs put obstacles in the way of students' acquisition of knowledge and skills. In addition, a part-time job may reduce their sense of happiness as students. After class, most college students like to do some sports with their friends or enjoy the colorful campus life in other ways. It is unwise togive upall those and step into society while one is not well prepared for it. Moreover, part-time jobs may bring college students risks and danger due to their lack of social experience. A college student may be bullied or taken advantage of by an unkind boss.

In conclusion, it is unadvisable for college students to have part-time jobs. College students are not yetmature enough and they deserve the happiness which belongs to their age. What they should do is to concentrate on their normal school life, and acquire enough knowledge and skills for the future.

","","Should Local Dialects Be Allowed on Campus?

With the rapid development of our country, college education has become more accessible and affordable for high school graduates. Students from different regions will meet on one campus. Should they be allowed to use their own local dialects? People, including the students, their parents, the policy makers, and school authorities, differ in their opinions.

Some people, especially the policy makers and the school authorities, insist that local dialects should be discouraged on campus. They believe the wide use of local dialects will somehow make it difficult for students from different places to communicate. In addition, local dialects might become the obstacleto the establishment and development of friendships between students in a class or in a dormitory.

Other people, however, hold a different point of view. They maintain that tolerance is important in a modern and diverse society, and therefore, different local dialects should be allowed in colleges. Local dialects represent a variety of cultural origins. College should become the very place for the expression and promotion of cultural diversity. Forbidding the use of dialects is against the core values of a university.

As far as I'm concerned, local dialects should be allowed in colleges. China is a large country with a variety of local customs and traditions which are often reflected or conveyed by local dialects. If we discourage the use of them, it might be harmful for the flowering andflourishing of local cultures.

Nowadays, there are many national holidays in China. Some people prefer long holidays such as the National-Day holidays and the Spring Festival, while others prefer short holidays such as Qingming and Duanwu.

People who hold the former opinion always think as follows. First of all, people can enjoy a long holiday to visit some scenic spots, relatives or friends far away from where they live. Furthermore, only long holidays can refresh people from their routine work. Finally, long holidays such as the Spring Festive can enhance the traditional family ties, and the spiritual and cultural customs of China can be well-preserved in this way.

Still, there are others who stand up to the latter view. The reasons can be listed below. To begin with, long holidays are achieved at the sacrifice of short breaks, which means that people have to work longer periods for a long holiday. They don’t regard it as worthwhile. What is more, short holidays can also supply with enough time for them to enjoy a long journey on the condition of efficient traffic system.

As far as I am concerned, I prefer short holidays, for I would like to shiftmy work and leisure more frequently. Sometimes long holidays also make me feel exhausted. I believe that shorter holidays bring no less fun than the longer ones.

Cross-cultural communication refers tothe communication between individuals from different cultural backgrounds .

With economic globalization, the increase in international business and in foreign investment has created a need for executives with knowledge of foreign languages and skills in cross-cultural communication. Meanwhile , with theadvancement of science and technology, the whole world has been shrunk as a small village where people from all over the world can exchange views and communicate with each other easily. Therefore , there is no doubt that cross-cultural communication is necessary and indispensable for abetter undestanding .

For a start , in the financial areas , negotiating is the process of communicating back and forth for the purpose of reaching an agreement. In order to participate in either one, the negotiators must understand the ways in which people are persuaded and how acompromise is reached within the culture of the negotiation. That is to say , one who is equipped with skillful experience of cross-cultural communication can enjoythe final success in the international business arena.

Secondly , for most of us students ,communication with foreign classmates can broaden our horizon, enrichourknowlege about the other part of the worldas well as helpusappreciate the totally different cultural custom.

Last but not least, we canestablishgenuine relationships with the foreign friends if we can talk witheach otherfreely , which will help to build a peaceful and harmonious world in the end.

However, as a classic proverb goes that no garden has no weeds, there is no denying that cross-cultural communication also brings about some unfavorable disadvantages. Cultural invasion can be really a serious problem. For example , many illegal organizations are intended to break China apart through cross-cultural communication. In the meantime, indigenoussplendid cultural relics may be fading from people's memory, which will cause an incogitable lossfor the nation.

In my view, we should, therefore , take advantage of the fruits and avoid the opposite aspect of cross-cultural communication. That is we should not only open ourselves to the outside world butalso be alert aboutthenegative behaviors of the illegal organizations.

Few people don't welcome success. However, not everyone can succeed. Of course, many factors result in people's failure, and one important reason is the qualities people possess. On the way to success, everyone will meet various difficulties and failures. Only those with good qualities are able to face the difficulties and overcome them. Those successful people may have different success stories. But if we take a close look at them, we may find they share some qualities which lead to their successes, such as confidence, persistence andcooperativeness.

I think a successful person must be confident in himself and what he does. Besides, he also should have persistence so that he will stick to what he is doing regardless of what others may say. If he has both qualities, he will not give up easily and won't get frustrated by failures. In addition, cooperativeness is also vital to a person's success. In today's society, a single person can hardly achieve anything high. Therefore, only a cooperative person can work well in a team and gain great achievements.

","","The Practice of Handwriting

It might be true that modern people would rather type than write with their own hands when communicating with others. Yet, I still think it necessary to practice handwriting.

With the popularity of computers nowadays, some people hold the view that the traditional way of writing letters to others is out of fashion. They see more and more people sending e-mails to each other on either business or personal matters. So they believe we can live in the modern world without handwriting at all. ""Post-it"" even becomes unnecessary since people can either make a phone call or send a message.

However, I hold the opposite view. I believe good handwriting would be more important just because people use it less. Sending e-mails might be quick, but informal, and sometimes not in arespectful manner. As with communications like greetings and congratulations, the phone has a way of lessening the warm feelings. On such occasions, good handwriting has a power of impressing others with your sincerity.

On the other hand, handwriting can tell one's personality, as no two people have identical ways of handwriting. And good handwriting would have an even greater effect when people are getting used to the same typed letters.

To sum up, to practice one's handwriting is not only necessary but also important in the modern world.

So it has become a mode for some profiteers to produce fake commodities, sell false medicine and use inferior materials. The only thing they are concerned about is their pockets, instead of other people's health and lives. If weallow these kinds of things to happen, people will no longer trust each other, and our society will become a hell.

Educators have expressed their concern that literacy among students is on the decline. Their worries are well grounded. In general, students lack enough comprehension and appreciation of text reading. The situation is even worse when it comes to writing. Many students struggle with words when putting their thoughts into writing and the compositions they write are disorganized, illogical, and full of misspellings.

There are a variety of factors accounting for the problem, among which a sharp decrease in the amount of reading is first to blame. Television and the Internet have distracted students' attention from reading books. Without the required input of reading, they can't acquire necessary writing skills. To make matters worse, the advance of telecommunications technology has greatly reduced or even eliminated the necessity of writing on the paper. Students make phone calls, send mobile phone messages or e-mail instead of writing letters.

Some effective methods on the part of students can be adopted to improve their literacy. They should realize the importance of literacy and give priority to book reading over TV watching and net surfing. As for the cultivation of writing abilities, practice can't be ignored. Students are supposed to create themselves more chances to write. For instance, it will be of much benefit to develop a habit of keeping a diary.

It is not uncommon that though we are poor inspoken English, we can write in English perfectly. This proves that we indeed can organize our ideas in English appropriately. Therefore, the main problem, I believe, is that we lack confidence and practice in spoken English. We often feel shy when we open our mouths to a foreigner.

So how we can overcome the obstacle in our spoken English has been obvious. First we need to overcome shyness and speak up confidently.

As is known to all, almost all the people swarm into the tide of examination-oriented education for the time being. However, is it really beneficial to the development of students? The answer should be no. It is nothing but an invisible barrier that hampers the full development of students' ability, intelligence and even honesty. To keep pace with the needs of society, quality-oriented education should be developed.

As far as I am concerned, the drawbacks of examination-oriented education include two main points. First of all, it cuts down the desire for knowledge and limits the passion for creation. Examinations do not motivate us to read widely, but restrict our reading; they do not enable us to seek more and more knowledge, but induce cramming. Also, no one can give his best when he is in terror, or after one or more sleepless nights, yet this is precisely what the examination system expects him to do. That is how we lose our passion and desire.

Secondly, the exams have too much impact on a person. Performing well on exams seems to be the only way to survive in fierce competition. Considering the increasing number of 'drop-outs': young people who are regarded as failures before they even embark on a career, we can easily understand the high suicide rate among students. Actually, exams may be a good means of testing memory, or the skill of working rapidly under extreme pressure, but they can tell little about a person's true ability and talent.

So it is high time that we took proper measures to put an end to any kind of examination-oriented education. I think the education department should think it over and make efforts to change. Students should also care more about theirfuture, and make positive efforts to improve the situation.

The negative effects on children make the situation even worse. Before babies are born, smoking begins affecting children. If the pregnant woman is exposed to secondhand smoke, the risk of birth defects would increase. Furthermore, children tend to imitate what they see, so they may regard smoking as a proper style of life and behave as so.

","","Job or Master's Degree

To seek a job or to pursue a master's degree, that's a question. Nowadays, most of the college students face this question after graduation. Some students choose to seek a job for they believe that working will help them accumulate more social and work experience, and work experience is just what the employer desires. Moreover, one can get a higher degree more easily when he or she has enough social experience and money after several years' work.

On the other hand, some other students insist on pursuing a master's degree. They make such a decision for the following reasons. Firstly, the number of college graduates grows each year, making the situation in the job market tighter and tighter. College graduates choose to pursue a master's degree in order to become more competitive in the future. Secondly, some research work requires a higher education background. Those who intend to go in for such work should seeka master's degree.

I think an undergraduate should pursue a higher degree if he or she is interested in some field and good at it. If one does not want to teach or go deep into research, he or she may as well seek a job after graduation.

Disposable goods refer to the things that are used once and then thrown away. Made of either wood, paper or plastic, they include various products such as plastic shopping bags, paper cups, and fast-food containers. They are widely used in almost every area of life, contributing to the convenience and comfort of modern life.

But on the other hand, disposable goods are a curse to nature, which pays a dear price for their production and consumption. For one thing, forests are destroyed to provide raw materials. For another, once used and disposed of, they become huge amounts of waste, so they are a principal criminal responsible for the worsening of the environment.

To protect the environment, each of us should take actions against disposable goods. We can reduce or avoidusing themin daily life and turn to environment-friendly or reusable products instead. At home or in the office, we can substitute glasses for paper cups, cloth towels for paper tissues. When we dine out, we should refuse to use throwaway chopsticks. As long as we sacrifice some of our temporary convenience, we can do a lot for the earth.

Instead of living on campus, an increasing number of college students prefer to live outside in a rented apartment. Thisphenomenon is disputed, attracting support as much as opposition.

Living off campus has both advantages and disadvantages. There are some clear advantages. Students don't have to share a room with several roommates, but have a room to themselves without disturbing others or being disturbed. They can also enjoy more freedom and a quieter learning environment. However, there are more disadvantages of doing so. The most important ones are as follows. To begin with, the students' personal safety can't be guaranteed. In addition, communication with their classmates will inevitably be reduced. Last but not least, freed of the disciplines and supervision that resident students are subject to, the studentswho live off campus tend to be distracted from their academic studies and worse still, to fall into ill habits.

To sum up, I think the disadvantages of living off campus far outweigh its advantages. Therefore, universities should forbid their students from doing so, and at the same time provide them with more pleasant living conditions.

Most drivers have the experience of getting stuck at one spot for10 minutes or longer, even for an hour. The problem of heavy traffic causes muchtrouble to people's lives.

There are chiefly three reasons for this situation. First, many old roads arein poor condition or not wide enough. Next, some people are not road-conscious, so motor vehicles compete with bicycles and people traveling on foot. Most importantly, the number of vehicles, particularly private cars, has dramatically increased over the past few years. Traffic accidents are likely to occur and thus the flow of traffic is slowed down.

The government has been trying every means possible to address the problem.In recent years, a great number of new roads have been laid down and quite a lot of old roads have been rebuilt.

Smoking is an unhealthy lifestyle and smoking in public places is not a plausible behavior. It pollutes the atmosphere, and nonsmokers will suffer from secondhand smoking, which causes cancer, respiratory problems and heart problems. This is unfair to nonsmokers. They haven't done anything wrong, and why should they pay for smokers' wrong doing?

There are many reasons for banning smoking in public buildings. First, banning smoking may keep the air clean in public places; second, it may help smokers to quit smoking temporarily, if not for good; third, nonsmokers are free of the risk of diseases caused by secondhand smoking. Therefore smoking in public buildings should be banned.

Nowadays, an increasing number of college students would rather rent anapartment off campus than live in a dormitory. This phenomenon has raised considerable concern among parents and college faculties about living off campus, which is caused bythe following reasons.

A rented apartment is often equipped with an independent washroom and a shower equipment which may be of great advantage over the school dormitory. In general, a typical dormitory oftenhas4 or 6, or even 8 students and it is too crowded and noisy forthose who prefer private space as well as quiet circumstances.

Due to China's rapid development, more and more overseas Chinese flock home to seek jobs. However, overseas returnees are no longer treated like rare species now and they find it difficult to geta job in China.

There are various reasons for their failure in the domestic job market. Firstly, overseas returneesset high standards towards employment. They think that they are superior to domestic talents and deserve better treatment. Therefore, they limit their choices to highly-paid positions in large companies in a few metropolises. Secondly, some overseas returnees' low quality disqualifies them from finding jobs in China. Since the implementation of reform and opening-up policy, studying abroad has become much easier. Not all the students studying abroad arehigh-achieving students now. Some of them are even low-scoring students. Therefore, they can't stand the fierce competitionin the domestic job market. Thirdly, employers tend to place higher demands on overseas returnees. They claim that not only diplomas of good foreign universities are required but also good personal ability and even work experiences abroad arenenessary in hiring the returnees.As a result, they became more cautious on their choice between overseas returnees and domestic talents these years.

Overall, in face of the difficulties in finding a job in the domestic job market, overseas returnees should notover-emphasize their overseas education background any more.Instead, they shouldadjust their attitudes and adapt to the environment while learning more about domestic policies and regulations. If they do so, it will be less difficult for them to find a good job in the domestic job market than before.

For instance, there are more kinds of pollution; the greenhouse effect makes our planet warmer and warmer. All of these things are mainly caused by the greenhouse gases. In one word, our homeland is at great risk and a low-carbon life may be a good solution to the problem.

Then how can we live a low-carbon life? Firstly, everyone should raise the awareness of low-carbon life and know our responsibility. Secondly, we should develop good habits in our daily life.

Yet they are not informed of the fact that the chemicals in the bags will release in high temperature. Therefore, they are eating the poisonous stuff while enjoying the tasty food.

It's enlightening and significant that our government has banned the free provision of disposable plastic bags in supermarkets. Trial practice has shown considerable reduction in the consumption of bags. In a word, fewer plastic bags lead to the sustainable development of our earth.

In our daily life, English abbreviations are widely used, in TV programs, in newspapers, and in billboards. Most English abbreviations are used mainly for convenience, for the economical purposes. However, the excessive use of English abbreviations, especially in the popular media has resulted in misunderstanding and even communication problems.

In the first place, miscommunication often arises from the use of English abbreviations. If some uses, like NBA, BBC or VOA, might be intelligible to most people, some other uses are totally strange and alien for Chinese people such as IRS or UNICEF. Popular media, like TV programs, are for the mass of people. But English in China is a foreign language. There are still a large number of Chinese who do not know much about English. In the second place, the excessive use of English abbreviations also cause harms to the use of our native language --- Chinese. Nowadays, some people almost get into the habit of mixing English abbreviations into their conversations in Chinese. Such usages are harmful to Chinese grammar and might sets bad examples to the Chinese beginners.

Limiting the use of English, especially in popular media will definitely facilitate communication and will also save people’s time for they don’t need to look them up in the dictionary. What’s more, it can also help language learners to acquire the correct grammar knowledge, both of Chinese and also of English.

","","","Is Popularity Good?

Toachieve popularity is the goal of many people. They believe that popularity is the most practical and useful measure of all things. Then to them, what catches the fancy of the multitude is good. No other standard is worth attention. They maintain that nobody will deny that the book Harry Porter is definitely a good book and so is the latest popular movie Avatar. A writer and an artist should take the multitude of people into consideration when they are producing a work otherwise they will be rejected or forgotten by the mass. This is fatal especially for an artist.

Other people, however, hold a different point of view. They maintain that people are to esteem discipline, skill, and taste that are required to produce enduring art. Therefore, in approaching a work of art, we need to prepare our imagination through learning and experience. Then it can be seen that popularity is not equal to good quality. What is really good might not be instantly accepted by the multitude of people. It is also true the other way round. This is universal for all areas. Nobody will deny that the most popular teacher among students does not mean he/she is the best teacher.

I am in favor of the second point of view. However, I also believe that people sometimes can become the measure of an artistic work. In China, many writers or artists achieved greatness by first achieving popularity among the mass of people. A case in point is Laoshe (老舍). Laoshe enjoyed great popularity among Chinese people and then his works remain in their heart forever.

Firstly, chances are good that group buying is more profitable than traditional individual selling strategies, that is to say, small profits but more turnovers.Secondly, consumers can enjoy services at a lower cost from buying new clothes, getting a new gadget, dining in an expensive restaurant to stayingin a five-star hotel, and experiencing that luxurious massage.It looks like a win-win choice to both sides of the deal.

However, in spite ofthe possible advantages brought by online group buying, we cannot turn a blind eye to its disadvantages. Obviously, quality problem is its first disadvantage. It's common that articles aren't so good as they are described online that customers always buy fake commodities. In addition, it's troublesome and annoying for many customers to make a change when they are not satisfied with what they bought online.

As far as I'm concerned, the benefits of onlinegroup buyinggreatly outweigh its drawbacks.Nevertheless, effective measures should be taken to make it better. Specifically speaking, government should work out strict regulations and rules to prevent unfaithful and unlawful activities of online shop owners.

Now, more and more college students are found to act as volunteers. Some choose to go to a nursing home to take care of the elderly and some work as part-time teachers at schools for migrant children. Moreover, in some big events like the BeijingOlympic Gamesand Expo, college students account for a large percentage of volunteers.

However, people's attitudes toward this phenomenon are different. Some people think this is a precious experience. Most college students are the only child in their families. Doing volunteering work enables them to care for others and love others. Also, they can accumulate valuable social experience.In contrast, some people don't think so. They tend to think that college students may spend too much time and energy doing volunteering jobs at the expense of their study. These people believe that students should always put their study in the first place.

As far asI am concerned, I firmly believe that doing some volunteering work is very helpful to foster college students' personalities and virtues. For example, many volunteers serving at Expo expressed that theybecame mature much faster than they were on campus. But of course, college students shouldn't neglect their study. And it is definitely unwise to lag behind because of doing volunteering work. The best way, Ithink, is to balance both sidesand thus students will benefit greatly.

"How should college students face stress” First, you should state clearly your observations of college students’ stress, and then provide some tips to help them to handle stress.

When I was in high school, I didn't feel much pressure and stress because I thought everything was in my control. But now when I am in SJTU, everything has changed. Sometimes I really feel stressed.

First, I’m always worrying about falling behind others. Of course all the students in IS did well in their high school. And there is a small gap between students from Inner Mongolia and those from other provinces. So I need to study hard day and night. But others may have the same idea like me mine, and they study hard too to catch up with others. I think we are in a circle that is full of competition. Now I’m faced with such pressure, and I don’t have a good idea to solve it. Maybe I should be satisfied with my grades and realize the fact that grades are not everything in my life.

Second, we gain chances to join many activities. Sometimes so many tasks are poured to you at the same time that you can’t arrange things in order. Also many activities will affect your study. Then you feel stressed and pressured because you want to manage them perfectly. Although I don’t join in many organizations, I sometimes really face this problem. I can imagine the pressure of my friends who join in many organizations. The best solution I can come up with is that we can list things that should be done. Then think about the priority and distribute proper time for these things. Then finish one by one in order. Maybe it can make a difference. In fact, no matter how stressed we are, we will finally become proud of ourselves because of what we will have achieved. And then more tasks come to us. It’s another circle in our life. Well, it’s really funny. Perhaps it’s the truth of life.

Finally, we also face financial pressure or other things. I think the best way to get through these difficulties is to believe in yourself and be optimistic in your life. I believe time will take your stress away.

For From my perspective, an ideal university is a place where we deal with everything depending on ourselves. We show our abilities in several aspects. We arrange lots of affairs in order. We manage ourselves in time and money. We grow up without the protection of our parents. We throw away many childish opinions through successes and failures. We try to deal with varieties of kinds of people. In such places, we gradually know who we are and what we can do. In such places, we concentrate on what we are doing. In such places, we gain chances to learn from others. In such places, we become mature because not only we once succeed but also we once fail. In such places, our outlook is much brighter.

Dear Li Ming,

As we know, taking the college entrance examination has far-reaching significance to our lives, but I don't think it's necessary to feel severely stressed about it.

Believe it or not, feeling stressed always has a negative effect on you. You may lose appetite andmay notwant to go over the subjects in the following days before the approaching examination. Consequently, it will in turn distract you from your revision work,which is of great importance.

I can tell you some shortcuts to relieving stress. First of all, don't repeat the very word ""examination"" every now and then in your mind. You shouldcalm down and stay coolto focus on the revision of the subjects. Second, I suggest that you should listen to some Chinese classical music to ease your mind when you feel stressed. Third, walking around on campus, either alone or with friends,is also a good way to help you relax. In a word, you should createa relaxed atmosphere to prepare yourself for the coming challenge.

Wish you good luck.

Like the poor fish in troubled waters, the choking public are at a loss and panic what to drink and eat.

The market economy makes it possible for the unqualified producers to get access to the market. If the manufacturing practices are under insufficient supervision, maximum-profits-making producers with no conscience and moral standards will surely fish in troubled water. And consequently the safety monitoring departments are put in the teeth of the storm.

So the first and the most important step is to purify the water. One the one hand, a moral norm in the Market economy should be established so that producers, no matter they are rural peasants, new starters of small businesses or manufactures with R & D labs will take their business and public's wellbeing seriously. On the other hand, the sales agencies and departments are responsible to stock and sell the qualified products. Whenever the faked and unqualified products are found or complained about, they should be recalled immediately before being seen into.

There is also no shirking of responsibility for the governments and departments to increase their commitment to food monitoring and supervising in every field from the production to sales stage. And ""food defense"" programs driven by a whim or a sudden pulse is of course not enough to curb the rampant food adulteration. Rather, the benefit of the public requires the programs be launched on a daily base. And strong legislation and fierce regulations should go first before the money-making-oriented merchants dare to take risks at the cost of the impairment to the health of the public.

All in all, if every citizen and government department take good care of their own business, their will not be such problems. And both the fish and water and fisherman can live in peace with each other.

In recent years, with the development of science and technology, many aspects of our liveshave beentotally changed. Undoubtedly, there is no exception to education. For the purpose of improving the teaching quality, many universities have already adopted high-tech instructional instruments in classroom teaching, such as projector, iPad and so on. This phenomenon has given rise to much controversy among the public.

A large majority of students and teachers are in favor of the idea of adopting the new technology in education. They point out the fact that the traditional teaching method is too tedious and rigid, while high-tech instructional instruments can provide the students with pictures, sound and videos, which can make the teaching more vivid. Thus, the students' learning interesthas beengreatly aroused. They also argue that the adoption ofthe high-tech instructional instruments is more effective.They can save much time of blackboard-writing and enable the teaching to be more compact. In addition, it is also a positive attempt to educational reform.

However, other people stand on a different ground. They consider that the sound, pictures and videos provided by the high-tech instruments may distract students'attention from study. And the students' economic status is another consideration. An example can give the details of this argument. Not long ago, a professor in Shanghai University required all students in his class to get an iPad for the teaching purpose.

In my life I have met a great many people who are really worth recalling. But perhaps the most unforgettable person I ever know is my English teacher.

What frequently brings back memories of my school teacher is his special qualities. First and foremost, he gave us the greatest gift a teacher can offer—an awakening of a passion for learning. He not only led us to an appreciation of the beauty and perfection of English language and literature, but also aroused our great interest in exploring something deeper in this field. Furthermore, I was attracted by his lively wit. I remember that we students always anticipated his class with great eagerness because his lecture were humorously delivered, never failing to provoke chuckles or loud laughs.

Although it is nearly two years since I attended his last class, he is the talk of our old classmates, and I know part of him has already stayed in my heart.

Nowadays, there has appeared a heated discussion among the college students as to whether they should live alone outside the campus or live together with other roommates in the students' dormitory. Opinions are divided over the matter.

Those who are in favor of Living alone maintain that it is very convenient to live by themselves. They can enjoy absolute freedom in a room of their own. They can have their own timetable without disturbing others. They are also free to equip the room with a personal computer so that they can have easy access to the Internet.

But others argue that living with roommates has attractions of its own. With several students sharing the same room, each person's experiences can be greatly enriched. They can learn a lot from talking to one another. By learning to tolerate the differences between individuals, they can become more mature.

As far as I'm concerned, I prefer to live with roommates because I love the feeling of belonging. Besides, it is a lot cheaper to live in a dorm than to rent a apartment outside the campus.

But people need to be careful. There are dangers associated with credit cards. Some people find it very easy to exceed their budget. They are tempted to purchase goods that they do not really need, and can become quickly overburdened by debt. The credit cards often charge a high rate of interest, which exacerbates the problems for these people.

However, used wisely credit cards can improve the quality of people's lives. They can give people access to money to meet sudden unplanned expenses. Properly handled, they can let people control their expenditure and the monthly statements provide a record of where their money has gone.

With the rapid development of our national economy, private cars have become in large number; of course, quite a few cars are heavily driven into College Campus.

In a significant way, these cars do not take up students' places for study, but actually affect their daily life and study—for instance, this crowd of cars may make noise and emit filthy gas to choke us to death. And the campus is jammed with lines of cars and seems to be parking lot instead of an academic institute. So cars have been strictly prohibited into many College Campuses. It seems that this is not convenience to some persons, indeed, but this is for the sake of our safety. Thus when someone enjoys convenience from modern tools, don't forget that it is dangerous to the students in the College Campus. Therefore, I agree that cars are not allowed into College Campus.

By and large, with the price of cars falling significantly, cars will enter average families, and most Chinese will enjoy a luxurious lifestyle in their life. However, they are still prohibited to drive their cars into College Campus, which, I think, is a hard truth in the eyes of most people.

In my view, stiffer laws and regulations must be implemented to check pollution. Industries that release wastes without permission should be heavily fined. Cars should be equipped to minimize the exhaust they release into the air. And the use of plastic bags and disposable meal boxes should be banned. What’s more, the media should play an important role in implanting a sense of environmental consciousness into people’s mind.

On the one hand, parents are suggested to provide more practical opportunities for their children, especially those involved in cooperation, challenge and problem-solving, such as a meaningful internship or a military summer camp. On the other hand, parents should guide their children to make decisions by themselves, and in the meantime, encourage them to take the correspondent responsibility. Frustration and practice are the best incubators for independence.

There goes a humorous saying that ""Quitting smoking is the easiest thing in the world. I've done it hundreds of times."" This saying reflects the fact that people lacking a firm resolution often pick up what they have given up over and over. They are a perfect example showing that nothing succeeds without a strong will.

A strong will is a kind of good quality which successful people normally possess. Two reasons attribute to it. First and foremost, only having a strong will can one have the strength to face the long path to success, which is sometimes tedious and therefore needs patience and perseverance. Secondly, a strong will can help one overcome frustrations and obstacles encountered on the way to success. With a weak will, one can hardly achieve anything but go round in circles.

As for students like us, we should have a good attitude towards failure. Facing with difficulties and failures, keep heads up and never give up. In short, a strong will plays a crucial role in attaining success, just as a saying goes that ""where there is a will, there is a way.""

Second, some teachers’ classes could not attract students’ interests so that some students would rather skip classes to study what they are interested in.

Some netizens support the Internet real-name system. They hold that people should be responsible for what they do and what they say on the Internet just as in the real world. They also list the advantages in terms of fraud prevention and network security protection. On the contrary, other people are concerned that if the real-name registration system is enforced, the freedom to conduct discussion and exchange of ideas online will be threatened. Another problem is that it is hard to protect a netizen’s right of privacy once their real identity is available on the Internet.

In my opinion, the real-name system is necessary in some fields of the Internet, for example, e-commerce. But for those blog users and other netizens, a real-name system is unjustifiable.

With the ever wider use of the Internet, online shopping is growing tremendously. People now can buy almost everything on the Internet ranging from foods, books, clothing to furniture.
The most important advantage of online shopping is its convenience. Online shopping allows consumers to shop at home with 24-hour access and save time traveling to retail stores. Also, consumers can exchange information online through chatting and discussion forums to help them make wiser and better decisions. But online shopping has disadvantages as well. Privacy and security are the top concern of consumers. Many consumers are worried about credit card frauds and the use of their information for other purposes.
With the improvement on privacy and security of the Internet, online shopping will gain respect and trust from consumers and will be much more widely used than today to benefit both the society and individuals. Eventually, more people will adapt to online shopping technology and will be able to enjoy the convenient and innovative way of shopping.

In order to get high profits, some manufacturers produce fake commodities ranging from toys and shoes to medicine and refrigerators. Undoubtedly, these fake commodities do harm to both consumers and society.

The direct victims of fake commodities are consumers. Consumers often buy fake commodities for their low prices, but they have to realize that these fake commodities are not only of low quality but also potentially harmful. Fake toys can cause accidents resulting in serious injury or even death. Fake commodities such as food and medicine may cause irreparable harm to the health of consumers. Fake commodities also harm society. If fake commodities prevail, manufacturers of authentic products will lose profits. This unfair competition will bring about market disorder.

Consumers should firmly say no to fake commodities. By rejecting fake products, consumers protect themselves in the long run. It is also the government’s responsibility to protect genuine commodities and crack down on fake ones.

Firstly, many celebrities cannot serve as role models for young people. Some of them are reckless drivers; some are drug takers; and some are tax evaders. These celebrities have a very bad influence on young people who are not mature enough yet. Secondly, a lot of young people spend too much time and energy on getting information about their celebrities. They want to know what their celebrities are saying, what they are wearing, where they are going and whom they are together with.

Celebrity worship is common and a little celebrity worship can be good and healthy. But too much celebrity worship is really harmful, much the same as addiction to alcohol and drugs. And it may badly affect a person’s real relationships.

In their views, those people with high income work hard and long. Besides, these people bring high efficiency, and create more wealth. Accordingly, they deserve high pay.

　　On the other hand, there are always some people who view this gap negatively. They believe that a lot of crimes happen as a result of this income gap. Some people make so little from their work that they risk taking criminal acts to get rich. In fact, experts have long found out that most cases of crime are directly related to low income. There is another point to back up a negative view against income gap. For most people, income gap may destroy the satisfaction that they obtain from work.

　　 As anything has two sides, so has the problem of income gap. Personally, I believe that this gap may motivate people to compete better in job market. When this gap is growing too wide, however, our government should make some policies to get rid of its negative consequences.

","","On Students Selecting Lecturers

Nowadays, there arises a kind of education reform trial in some universities—to allow students to choose their favorite lecturers for some specific courses. The motivation is to offer college students a more flexible and efficient way of learning as well as to provide a more competitive environment for teachers.

Generally speaking, there are two factors for students to consider when choosing their favorite lectures. First and foremost is the teacher's academic ability, as the students hope to get more knowledge in a specific field. Secondly, the teacher's personality is also taken into account. If the teacher is kind, charming and humorous, the students will be more likely to enjoy the classes they attend and learn a lot from the good example the teacher sets.

Nevertheless, attention should be paid to the measure of free choosing lecturers because it has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it encourages the students to choose their ideal lecturers and take active part in classes. This in turn exerts pressure on the lecturers as they all want to be ""the chosen one"" and thus will improve their own teaching. On the other hand, some excellent but serious and strict lecturers may be ignored and have no classes to teach because they don't know how to please the students.

","","Due Attention Should Be Given to Spelling

Nowadays, students pay little attention to the spelling of words in English-learning. Their writing abounds with lots of spelling mistakes.

There are mainly two reasons accounting for this phenomenon. To begin with, exam-oriented education, in which the focus is English grammar, makes the teachers attach little attention to spelling in teaching. What's more, some students are unaware of the importance of the spelling. Some of them hold the view that the content of writing outweighs the form; others believe it is a waste of time to remember words, since there is an E-dictionary.

Spelling to a piece of writing is what appearance to a person. Correct and neat spelling can not only present the writer's opinion in a more clear and valid way, but also reflect the writer's serious attitudes of writing. Schools should set effective mechanisms to help teachers as well as the students to realize the importance of spelling. For students, they should try to remember words through many effective ways.

In my opinion, three factors may account for this phenomenon. To begin with, present exams contain few questions relevant to spelling. As a result, students aiming mainly at good performance in exams pay less attention to spelling. Next, teachers are partly to blame for it because they don’t emphasize too much the importance of spelling in their teaching. Last but not least, many students themselves haven’t realized word spelling that important and meanwhile are too lazy to spend much time memorizing and practising it.
To solve the problem, several measures can be adopted. First of all, exams should be modified to add more subjective items involving students’ spelling abilities. Besides, schools and teachers should set up some mechanisms and organize more relevant activities to help students realize the importance of correct spelling, for only when they become aware of it can they be active to make improvements in spelling.

Nowadays the phenomena of excessive packaging of goods are prevailing in our society: clothes swathed in tissue paper, placed in cardboard box and finally wrapped in well-designed plastic bags, imported bottles of grape wine packed in wooden boxes, fruits put in hand-woven baskets, to name but a few.

There are several causes of excessive packaging. The first reason is that a large number of companies believe that they can attract customers’ attention and stimulate their purchasing desire by over-packaging their goods, thus gaining more profits. On the other hand, quite a number of consumers mistakenly hold that the more delicate the package is, the better the quality will be, thus encouraging excessive packaging.

In my point of view, excessive packaging has disastrous consequences, including the loss of precious resources, excessive consumption of water and energy, and unnecessary extraction of scarce land for landfill.To solve the problem, it’s necessary to take the following measures. First, laws and regulations must be made to restrict excessive packaging of companies. In addition, we need to raise consumer’s awareness that excessive packaging doesn’t equal to high quality and advocate packaging recycling.

Dear Wangli,

If you have no previous engagement at 7 pm on July 23rd, I want to invite you to dinner in the Garden Hotel.

We haven't enjoyed being together since we graduated from university, for everyone is too busy to have a reunion. So I'd like to invite you dinner together. To make it even greater, Mahong, our best friend, arrived in Kunming the day before yesterday. We haven't met her for a whole year since she left for overseas study. Now she has come back for her summer vacation. Last night, she asked me to invite you to have dinner with her.

We are looking forward to meeting together again.

"@@Due Attention Should Be Given to the Study of Chinese@@

1. 近年来在学生中出现了忽视中文学习的现象
2. 出现这种现象的原因和后果
3. 我认为
","Due Attention Should Be Given to the Study of Chinese

Nowadays, students attach little importance to the study of Chinese.

There are three reasons contributing to this phenomenon. First of all, the importance of English has been over-stressed by the society as globalization has made the whole world a village and English has become the dominant language in the world. Our attention has been drawn to the learning of English, and thus the study of Chinese has been neglected. Besides, colleges have encouraged students to spend more time on the study of English; while on the contrary, on campus we seldom have Chinese classes. Limited concern has been put on the learning of Chinese. What's more, it is natural to neglect the study of Chinese due to the wrong impression that as native speakers, we all have a good command of Chinese. This phenomenon will do harm to the development of our culture in the long run.

Measures should be taken to improve the situation. To begin with, government should pay more attention to the promotion of Chinese culture so that people, young and old, can learn more and be proud of our own language. Moreover, both the schools and the students should attach great importance to the study of Chinese.

","Should Euthanasia Be Legalized?

Euthanasiahas raised a number of agonizing moral dilemmas since it came into being. Is there a moral difference between killing someone and killing someone without causing them pain? Isit ever right to end the life of a terminally ill patient who is suffering a lot of pain?Should euthanasia be legalized?

Some peoplebelieve that euthanasia should not be legalized because euthanasia is against thelaw of nature. It weakens not only the society's respect for the sanctity of life,but alsopeople's courage to fight against diseases and hardship.

However, others hold the opposite opinion as they argue thatit violates an individual's right to refuse a dying person's request for euthanasia,increases the economic burden, andaggravates his suffering.

As far as I'm concerned, deciding todie or not is a personal decision. Neither the doctors nor the government has the power to make decision for him.Nowthatlaws givea personthe liberty tochoosehisjob and religion, why has heno right to decide onhis life? Ifa patient has a terminal or incurable disease, all he can do is to wait for death, andthe waiting time can be very painful for both the patient and the people around him.Consequently, provided thata patient voluntarily asks for euthanasia, the doctors should satisfy his desire.That's why euthanasia should be legalized.

2. 分析“啃老族”存在的原因

","On NEET

""NEET"" is the abbreviation of ""Not in employment, education or training"". It refers to the young grown-ups who still depend on their parents to give them money, although they have already graduated from college. They are not able to live totally on their own. They are even not prepared for living alone psychologically and rely on their parents for everything.

Why does this phenomenon exist? For one thing, children should be responsible for this. They tend to be taken good care of by their parents or grandparents from the very moment when they were born. They lack self-independence and responsibility and are unable to adapt to society once not under their parents' wings. For another, their parents are also to blame. They do everything for their children as they grow up, leaving them no chance to learn how to become independent. So once the children are suddenly exposed to the society full of challenges and uncertainties, they will be at a loss and do not know what to do. Disappointment, frustration and unemployment may follow. Naturally they will be very happy to come back again to their parents' protection and support, especially financial support.

How to make the young in NEET more independent, then? Firstly, parents should update their concept of bringing up children and intentionally cultivate independence in their children. Second, the young people also should train themselves in their life. They should learn how to face up to difficulties and setbacks. Only in this way will they probably create a bright future by themselves.

","Flash Marriage

There is a general discussion today about the phenomenon of flash marriage among young people. As it indicates literally, flash marriage describes establishing the marital relationship in a fraction of time, skipping the period ofknowing andgetting along with each other.Some argue that such speedy relationship may not last long. But people who advocate marriage freedom argue that young people have their own opinion about marriage and can be responsible for their behavior.

As society progresses, people's conception of marriage is changing. Financial burdens of keeping up a long-term relationship before marriage have proven to be too difficult for many lovers to handle. Speedy marriages seem to be more economical. But, flash marriage, or getting married without careful consideration, may cause severe social problems. One extreme example published by a Chinese newspaper goes like this: a young couple married in the morning, argued at midday and divorced in the afternoon.Flash marriage, for lack of mutual understanding, may lead to higher rates of divorce.

In my eyes, flash marriage is not fit for most of the young people. It is only acceptable to people who are mentally and psychologically mature and with a certain economic foundation. It's surely more sensible to know more about your partner before going down the aisle.

They believe that developing some art skills can cultivate children's tastes and broaden their vision in different fields. They also argue that attending art classes, to some extent, is a way to relieve the pressure of study on ordinary days, making them feel refreshed and then going back to study more energetically. However, other people hold an opposite viewpoint. They firmly point out that normal study activities will be disturbed. They consider art classes as extra burdens for children who have already had so many lessons to take.

And they are used through the life during which a good name may be helpful, like an easy-remembered name.

However, many hold the opposite view. They argue that name is but a code to distinguish one from another. They believe that the good wishes the names express to the person are merely imagination. A person with a common or casually given name can also achieve tremendous success.

Personally, both sides have their reasons. Names do carry elders' good wishes, and they may be helpful to some extent. And it should not be exaggerated that a name could go beyond to influence a person's future. Anyway, people should not go to extremes.

As is known to all, mental health is as important as, if not more important, than physical health for college students. However, it's quite worrying that nowadays some students are not quite mentally healthy. This is probably due to the heavy academic workload and unclear job prospect, exerting dual pressure on the students.

Undoubtedly, schools and universities should take responsibilities in improving students' mental health. Relevant courses and activities should be introduced into the curricula so that students would be more aware of the significance of mental health and find appropriate ways to maintain and improve it. For example, there should be a mental counseling hotline or office for students to turn to when they need some mental aids.

Of course, no mental health can be obtained without the efforts on the part of the students themselves. From my perspective, what they can do is trying to stay positive and active. To be more specific, they can participate in some activities such as voluntary work to cultivate an opening and caring mind. When they are indeed so low or confused that they can not cope with the situation themselves, students shouldn't feel ashamed for seeking mental counseling services.

"@@Will E-books Replace Traditional Books?@@

","Will E-books Replace Traditional Books?

With the rapid development of information technology, we are surrounded by all kinds of digital products including E-books in our everyday life. More and more E-books such as electric dictionaries and electric novels have gained increasing popularity among the public, especially among young students.

Some people argue that E-books will replace traditional books sooner or later, as they have so many advantages over the traditional ones. To start with, all the E-books can be downloaded from the Internet directly, most of which are free of charge, while the traditional books are much more expensive. Next, E-books can be stored more easily in our computers and are more convenient for people to carry around; and it is also easier to make notes to E-books without damaging them. Last but not least, possessing and reading E-books has become a kind of vogue in our life, which is particularly appealing to our younger generation.

As far as I am concerned, E-books won't replace the traditional ones in the current generation. For one thing, many people are still accustomed to reading paper books, let alone a huge number of people who don't have Internet access. For another, reading books on the screen may harm our eyes much more severely. But in the future, with the further development of information technology and with the popularity of computer and Internet, maybe E-books will take place of traditional books in a lot of fields.

Firstly, some pets, especially dogs,sometimes disturb people's normal life, such as dogs' barking at midnight, chasing and frightening people on the street. Some pets also are the source of disease infection. Secondly, it is frequently reported that some pets which are not supervised quite well wander on the road andcause severe car accidents.

On the other hand, some people are worried that these fashionable digital things will keep us from communicating with each other face to face to some extent. And the families also will spend less and less time together, which causes generation gap and indifference to people around us. If so, a product designed to make the world smaller actually makes people more distant from each other.

","Which Is More Important at University, Accumulating Knowledge or Developing Character?

College life can be one of the most beneficial, rewarding, and memorable experiences in one's life. It is often a turning point because it opens so many new doors and opportunities. However, students have to decide on where to focus their energies whilst at university. They must decide whether they should spend all their time studying or whether they should take the opportunity to develop and mature as human beings.

Some people think that their major task is to accumulate knowledge. As the old saying goes, “knowledge is power, andknowledge is wealth.” In order tobe able to acquire power andwealth after graduation, college students must study hard and accumulate as much knowledge as possible. Without knowledge, they believe, one will achieve nothing in the future.

In contrast, however, other people think that it is more important to develop character whilst at university. They believe that when college students leave their ivory towers and enter the real world, they will find it competitive, cruel and sometimes suffocating. They are likely to face a lot of hardship, setbacks, disappointments, frustration and failure. They will only survive these difficulties if they have developed a strong character which includes persistence, optimism and tolerance whilst they are at university.

I strongly believe that it is only by fostering a strong character that one can understand how to live successfully in the world, to make effective use of knowledge, to realize one's self-worth and to make a positive contribution to the world. Developing character allows one to make wise decisions and to face inevitable disappointments with courage and strength. Therefore, developing and maturing a strong and resilient character is moreuseful than only gaining huge amounts of knowledge whilst at university.

","On the Internet Addiction

There is a problem among college students that has aroused the educators' concern, i.e., some of these studentsare addicted to the virtual world. They spend many hours online each day playing computer games or chatting with their net friends. They are confined to the Internetin search of the fulfillmentwhich they believe is not readily obtained in real life instead.

The Internet addicts may not realize the harmthis habit doesto them. Sitting in front of the computer screen for a long time without doing any exercise is a strain on the body. The negative effects can also be academic and mental ones. It occupies too much of their time and distracts their attention away from studies. Moreover, communicating mainly through the net, the addicts have little chance or inclination to associate with real people.

","What Is the Priority, Economic Development or Environmental Protection?

As regards the question: which is more important, economic development or environmental protection, some people choose the former. In their opinion, environmental problems are inevitablesince they are the by-products of economic progress,and theycan be tackled later when money and time permit.

However, some others hold the opposite opinion. Since serious environmental problems threaten human living conditions as well as the earth, they deserve more attention than economic problems. The Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill is a good example. Though many attempts have been made to constrain and control the scale of this environmental disaster, such as spraying oil dispersants, building protective barriers, and capping the leaks, more than 818 tons of oil poured into the gulf. The damagewas remarkable. It not only destroyed the fishing industry and tourism of the Gulf of Mexico, but also brought over $50 billion loss to the American economy. Worse still, no one can predict the impact of this disasteron the future environment.

As far as I am concerned, environmental protection and economic development can co-exist in harmony. Our finalgoal is to pursue sustainable development and provide a comfortable life for people.I believe only bykeeping balance between environmental protection and economic development will we create a better life.

"@@Who Should Pay Our Tuition?@@

1. 大学教育需要每个学生缴纳学费

2. 现在大学生缴纳学费的方式多元化

3. 我的看法
","Who Should Pay Our Tuition?

Ever since the educational reform in the last decade, every college student has to pay for his/her higher eduction. However, 6,000-10,000RMBa year is much too high for most of the students.

Since most collegestudents have no income or bank savings at the age of 18 or 19,theypay their tuition fees in different ways. Firstly, in order to further their education, many students turn to their parents for help whoare willing to invest their money in their children's education. Secondly, the government has worked out some favorable policies for college students and required the banks to give priorities to education loan. Therefore, some students decide to apply for the low-interest education loan rather than ask parents for help in order to relieve the family of the burden. Thirdly, there is still a small group of students who take advantage of their leisure time, talent or special skills to earn enough moneyto tackle their tuition fees.

To my understanding, higher education shouldn't be regarded as a rare commodity that students have to pay a lot of gain. For this purpose, the government should adjust the policy by reducing the tuition fees of higher education. Meanwhile, it is not the parents' obligation to pay their adult children's tuition. To alter the embarrassing situation, the government shouldset up more scholarships to finance the talented students. In addition, the whole society should provide a favorable environment either by donating or by providing more part-time vacancies to those students, which not only tackles their economic dilemma but also helps them accumulate sufficient working experience before they enter society.

","My Views on Private Cars

The first decade of the new millennium hasseen a growing number of families get their own cars. And having a car is no longera dream for many Chinese families today.

It is obvious that the growing number of private carsindicates the improvement of our living standards. Cars are nowaffordable items formany peoplebecause the pricesof our carsare lowering and our income is increasing. Besides, our government has enforced favorable car-selling policies. With the world's largest population, we have the world's largest potential consumers. What's more, a car offers not only flexibility to people's life but also a quick access to a variety of services.

However, the excessiveincrease of private cars causes a series of social and environmental problems. Firstly, the rapid growth of private cars is not in accordwith the expansion and improvement of infrastructures. The old urban roads are not widened yet and there aren't enough parking lots, which finally leads to heavy traffic jams during the rush hours in metropolises like Beijing and Shanghai. What's more, the quick growth of private cars will definitely worsen the air condition before we work out a solution to purify it.

As far as I am concerned, we should consume smart and live smart. To own a car or not should depend on our daily need. If our life is regular and the public traffic is convenient and comfortable for daily commuting, then there is no need for us to buy a car. Besides, the government shouldn'tneglect environmental protection while developing the economy. To invest more in the construction of infrastructure and encourage the public transportation is the way out of the serious situation of heavy traffic and air pollution.

Nowadays, many college students cannot find a stable job after graduation and choose to stay around campus waiting for a better chance. Therefore, they have gained a name ""campus drifters"".

The existence of ""campus drifters"" might be attributed to different reasons. For instance, some students join this group because they want to seize another chance of taking part inthe entrance exams for postgraduate schools, while others, unsatisfied with their present job, would rather stay around to look for a better chance. Though living around campus may offer them a good learning and living environment with a relatively lower expense, ""campus drifters"" may still be confronted with some problems such as loneliness, financial difficulties andgreat pressure arising fromthe uncertainty of future life.

Despite the prevalence of this phenomenon, I am totally against it. Drifting around campus for a long time is likely to have a negative effect on the graduates. They may become doubtful about their abilities and lack confidence in themselves. So it is beneficial for them to form an objective evaluation of themselves, find a suitable place in the society and put an early end to their campus drifting days.

In 2007, China cut the May Day holiday from seven to three days to ease overcrowded travel. However, since that change, a growing number of people have begun to discuss whether we should resume the seven-day holiday or not.

Many people prefer to resume the May Day holiday. They hold the view that after the long winter season, people will have a strong desire for a longholiday to travel and relax, and the May Day holiday is the best season for them to do so. What's more, the holiday plays an important role in promoting tourism development, and under the current global financial crisis, it is more necessary than ever to resume the holiday. China's Guangdong Province has already resumed the weeklong May Day holiday in 2010 in a bid to revive the economy.

However, some people think that it is unwise to change the span of the national holiday so frequently.For one thing,it is not convenient for some companies to set their long-term developing plan. For another, the large traveling flock in a concentrated time will overburden the public transportation.

In my opinion, the weeklong holiday should be resumed. Firstly,a seven-dayholiday can satisfythe need of the majority of the public. Secondly, a three-day holiday is too short for people to travel and some companies regard it as a common weekend and deprivetheir staff ofthe right to take a rest by assigning them excessive tasks.

In recent years, the housing pressure in big cities has caused great concern among the government and ordinary people. People in big cities are complaining about the housing shortage and the soaring prices of houses.

There are many factors contributing to this problem. Firstly,people's choices of and attitude toward living are major factors leading to the housing problem. Modern people tend to regard home more as a sign of social status and wealth than as a shelter against nature. Therefore, they would like to purchase asmany houses as possible, which disturbs the balance of thehousing market.Secondly, an increasing demand for larger and more comfortable houses is pushing up the housing prices which havebecome unaffordable even for the middle-income people, let alone the low-income people.Lastly, many people are reluctant to live away from the city as they prefer the more diverse, convenient and stylish urban life, no matter how crowded it is.

Some measures have been takenby the government and have proved quite effective. For example, preferential policies have been worked out to promote the construction of high-rise apartment buildings to meet the demand for more economical use of land.Apart from this, satellite towns are built around the city to attract the urban population and meet their housing demand. However, policies and government actions alone cannot solve the problem completely. The other important key isto change people's concept.

Due to the enhanced speed of online communication and people's rapid reaction to global news,it seems that the world becomes smaller than before.

Secondly, the highly condensed city population doesn't usher in highly connected human relationship due to the vertical designing ofthe apartments.

The seven-day National Day holiday has come to an end. It seems as a trend that the ticket prices of many scenic spots have been raised higher than usual during the golden-week holiday. Take MountHuangshan in AnhuiProvince for example, the price is around 340yuan per person.

On theone hand, some people point out that during the golden week raising ticket prices of popular scenic spots can help promote the development of local economies and increase local revenues to a large extent.

On the other hand, a group of people are still against such practice during the golden week. Firstly, higher prices cannot guarantee better services. Besides, higher ticket prices will discourage many people from visiting scenic spots, which is notbeneficial for the development of the tourism industry in the long run.

We must bear the concept in mind that customers are of great importance.

BMI,or body mass index, is one common standard to judge whether a person is overweight or not. Normal weight requires the value of BMI shouldn't overrun 25. Recently, the phenomenon that over10 percent of teenagers' value of BMI has exceeded 30 has aroused wide concern,because obesity is harmful to teenagers'physical healthand can lead to illness or increasing risk of death.

As is known to all, many factors could contribute to obesity. Admittedly, lack of physicalexercise and overeating are the main causes of obesity. On the one hand, nowadays, with the stress of everyday learning and examinations, teenagers have serious psychological stress. Therefore, they have no choice but to spendthe majority of their time focusing on their studyand have no enoughtime to do outdoor activities. On the other hand, parents always hold the opinion that the heavy school work might cause malnutrition. As a result, they usually provide their childrenwithtoo much nutritious food, which also gives rise to the problem of obesity.

In my opinion, first of all, teenagers should be aware of the fact that obesity does harm totheirhealth seriously. They should take care of their body and strike a proper balance between work and rest. Secondly, teachers and parents have responsibility for leaving teenagers somefree timeto take exercise. Last butnot least, the whole society must attach importance to this problem and take measures in time. Only in this way can teenagers bekeptaway from obesity and have a healthy and happy life.

"@@Robots with Artificial Intelligence@@

3. 我的看法
","Robots withArtificialIntelligence

Ever since robots with artificial intelligence were invented, they have been used for jobs in various fields. Therefore, some people believe that they will be able to do all the things that we humans can do. However, in my opinion, as every coin has two sides, so it is in the case of robots. They have their own pros and cons.

Robots with artificial intelligence can assist human society in various ways. First, with robots, people will be free from manual labor and have more time for more scientific studies as well as leisure pursuits. Second, robots can take the place of humans in dangerous working conditions. They can work on the sea bed, in the mines and even in outer space.

However, we should not turn a blind eye to the disadvantages of using robots with artificial intelligence. Unemployment which results from applying robot labor will lead to many social problems, or even social instability. Moreover, as robots only do what they are taught or programmed, theymight be abused by those obsessed with unrighteous ambitions and schemes. In that case, world peace would be seriously endangered.

To summarize, there are both pros and cons to the usage of robots with artificial intelligence. If they can be properly operated and put to good ends, they will definitely become a decisive force leading us humans to a better future. Otherwise, people will have to be trapped in the problems caused by the misusage of robots with artificial intelligence.

"@@On College Students' Freedom@@
1. 大学生享有很大的自由
2. 过多的自由对大学生来说有利有弊

3. 我的观点
","On College Students' Freedom

Compared with high school students, college students enjoy much more freedom. They get a lot of timeat their own disposal, they have diverse courses to choose from, and they can also make decisions on their daily affairs.

If the students can make good use of this freedom, they may benefit a lot in many aspects. For students who have particular interest in some subjects, they may pursue further study in those fields. For students who are keen in social work, they can join various organizations or associations to develop and display their abilities. And for students who want to support themselves, they may take some part-time jobs to make money.

On the other hand,excessive freedom can also have negative influence on college students. Faced with so much free time and so many choices, some students may get puzzled. Some of them may feel overwhelmed or aimless due to too many courses they register for or various activities they get involved in.Moreover, some students even get lost in the face of too much liberty. Eventually, they willbe spoiled and lose their self-control. As a result, they may become addicted to computer games or idle away their precious time in various meaningless entertainments.

As a college student, I think two things may help us take full advantage of freedom. First, we must set up clear goals for life and study, and learn to prioritize things. Second, we should realize that freedom means responsibility. We have to be rational in every single decision that we make. In this way freedom can make our college life more colorful and more meaningful.

","On Garbage Sorting

Many Chinese cities are now facing the problem of growing piles of trash, and the misconception of ""garbage is useless"" makes the situation even worse. People seldom sort their garbage into categories, which brings more trouble to garbage disposal, recycling and environment protection.

The traditional way of burning or burying garbage in landfillsis partly to blame. It hasmisled the public and made the people thinkthere was no use sorting the garbage. People lack the basic knowledge that different types of garbage, includingkitchen waste, recyclable material or others, could be processed in different ways. They know little aboutthewaysto sort the garbage and the significance to recycle and utilize it. Lack of funds is another reason. The investment in community infrastructure is not sufficient, which causes the lack ofrecycle bins.

Garbage sorting is beneficial to both the environment and people's health in the long run. Efforts should be made by the government, the community and the public to promote the notion of garbage sorting and recycling, not only for the sake of the environment but also for the sustainable development of the society.A nationwide garbage campaign should be launched. Green posters with instructions on how to separatedifferent types of garbage should be put up in public places, and garbage-sorting brochures should be sent out to popularize this constructive idea.

With the joint efforts of the government and the people, garbage sorting can be implemented successfully and our environment will become better and more habitable.

","No Longer ""Shopping""

In this worldof greater material wealth, shopping is viewed not only as a meansof obtaining daily necessities, but also as a popular leisure activity. Many people feel an impulse to go to supermarkets, shopping malls and online stores when they are in a good or bad mood, and they often spend more than they earn on things they don't really need.

There are several reasons for this growing interest in shopping. In the first place, fast economic development has allowed a greater variety of commodities to be produced, displayed and sold. A shopper planning to buy some food in the supermarket may bring home clothes and many other things that he likes rather than needs. Also, many shopping venues have provided entertainment and service facilities that make people's shopping experience more comfortable and enjoyable. For example, some large shopping centers provide baby-sitting services to young mothers who can then take time to enjoy a day-long, relaxing shopping trip.

It seems that people's being free and able to shop whatever and wherever they like is an indication of wealth and prosperity, and by encouraging consumption and production, the whole world's economy will improve. However, the negative impacts of modern consumerism should not be overlooked.It is a pity to see unrestrained shopping replacing healthier activities of visiting the park, going to the church and regular community gathering. What's more, the more one shops, the more packaging waste one produces and thisposes a threat to the environment.

Nowadays, individualismandteam spiritare in hot discussion across the society. On the wayto success, which is better, individualism or team spirit?

Some people uphold individualism. They believe that individualism is a social outlook that these individualists are so independent and self-reliant that they can set their own goals and desires and oppose most external interference in their own interests, whether by society, family or any other people. What's more, individualists think they can develop well by their own and form better characters.

Meanwhile, others attach importance to team spirit. They believe that four eyes can see more than two and people can benefit a lot from mutual discussion. In a team, everyone plays their own role, and can work just like an assembly line making full use of their superioritiesand maximizingeffectiveness. Moreover,there is asaying that every man hashis faults.In spite ofthe factthat team members are not the best of all and have their weaknesses, teamspirit can overcome these shortcomings and helpthem get improvement altogether.

","Is Job-hopping Beneficial for Individual Development?

Job-hopping, as a common phenomenon in the society, has been a focus of people's attention. Some people think that job-hopping is beneficial for personal development in the long run, because it will enrich one's work experience, broaden one's professional horizons, and stimulate one's pursuit of personal perfection. What's more, job-hopping will help foster one's positive attitude toward work and optimistic outlook as well.

Conversely, other people hold the view that job-hopping will not do any good to personal development. If people pay their attention merely to changing jobs, how can they concentrate on the present job? Without working hardtoday, how can they expect to have a successful career tomorrow? Only when one devotes himself to the present job whole-heartedly can he achieve the goal of advancing personal development.

Personally, I agree on the first viewpoint. In my perspective, job-hopping does not mean being absent-minded in the present job. On the contrary, it means one should commit himself to the present job, trying to make full use of the golden opportunity to learn from and practice in working, and digging out one's full potential. Then, when the time comes, one can consider changing for another jobwhere one can learn more, benefit more and contribute more.Therefore, a virtuous circle forms that will benefit personal development greatly.

Some Western holidays are very popular in China nowadays and the most popular one might be Christmas. Each year after mid-December, wherever you go, you can see snowflakes, bells, stockings, decorated Christmas trees and smiling Santa Clauses.Besides, recent years have also seen many things of heart shapes such as chocolates, flower bunches, or other various gifts in Spring Festival, not because the traditional celebrations have been changed, but because the Valentine's Day is approaching. In China, the Valentine atmosphere created by media has evengone further than that in Western countries.

With increasing Chinese natives joining in the celebrations of differentWestern holidays each year, some people worry that traditional Chinese holidays, most of which areof many centuries long standing, might bereplaced and that the faith and love toward traditional Chinese holidays, particularly among the youth, will fade away gradually.However, some other people argue that with the internationalization and globalization of the world, it is a trend that many important holidays in different cultures are going to merge themselves into other cultures.

In my opinion, it is a sign both of the natural process of cultural selection and of social development that Western holidays are celebrated in China. Though warmly celebrated, Western holidays would never take the place of traditional Chinese holidays. Take Christmas for example, it would never be celebrated in its original religious way in China. For most Chinese, it has always been a relaxing party time for teachers and students, friends and coworkers, lovers and shopping-goers who would like to take advantage of the sales. On the other hand, Chinese culture has developed to a desirable degree—while welcoming cultures from other peoples and nations, ithas alsobeenwelcomed by many other cultures.

In recent years, a lot of classicshave beenremoved from high school Chinese textbooks in some provinces, which include some famous short stories and essays by the late, great writers likeLu Xun and Zhu Ziqing. These changes have brought a nationwide debate.

Credit cards are instruments issued by banks or credit unions to customers to enable them to acquire goods, services or cash on credit. There is no doubt that using credit cards has already become a new fashion as a result of the industrial revolution and development of information technology.

Here are some reasons why the use of credit cards has become modern people's lifestyle. First of all, it is of great convenience. When shopping by credit cards, what we need to dois just passing the credit card to the assistant instead of having a hard time seeking the cash and waiting for the change. Everything will be finished within seconds by keying in the password. In addition, when we are confronted withsome emergencies and lack of money, the card allows us to withdraw a certain amount of money and pay it back later. Last but not least, using credit cards provides us a chance to enjoy more bank services even if we have no bank savings. If we behave honestly as what we promised when applying for the card, the bank or the credit institutions will grant us more benefits.

Although credit cards are becoming a more acceptable part of the financial sector, there are still some issues that we have to pay attention to. One is excessive consuming. Along with installment plans, rental and leasing schemes, credit cards provide encouragement to spend more money. Some people willgive into the temptation to live beyond their means.

The past decade has been seeing the rapid development of cloning technology. Ever since the birth of the first cloned sheep in Great Britain in 1996, numerous reports about species cloning have brought continuous good news to not only the scientific field but also the average readers.

However, when we talk about human cloning, people's attitude varies. On the one hand, for some infertile couples, cloning represents the only hope of having a child carrying their genes.

On the other hand, the hypothesis of human cloning also brings a great panic to society. Human cloning is a radical challenge to the most fundamental laws of ethics. It causes chaos to traditional human relationship, because it is really hard to define the cloned copy. A son? A brother? Or another self? What's more, to clone a person would violate human dignity.

","Empty-Nest Families

An empty-nest family is one with an elderly person living alone or with his or her spouse. Statistics show there are 20 to 30 percent empty-nest families in big cities, and the percentage is as high as 40 percent in small towns. Most empty nesters are people aged around 60 to 80. But there is a tendency that a growing number of people aged between 40 and 60 are now empty nesters.

Many reasons account for this serious social problem in China today. First of all, the single-child family planning policy has created mini family structure as family members are decreasing. Most middle-aged Chinese are parents of the first single-child generation. Usually the single childrenwere the center of the families. Thus their moving-out causes not only the change of the family structure but also a great sense of loss to their parents. Besides, heavy burdens have forced the young generations to focus more on their work. Thus their parents are more likely to become ""empty-nest"" senior citizens because they have less time to stay at home even if they choose to live together with their parents. What's more, the new generation of only sons or only daughters has grown up and most of them choose to work in metropolises far from their hometowns and families, which causes the physical impossibility of living with parents.

As far as I am concerned, community centers should host seminarswhich helpparents figure out how to move forward since they cannot drastically change the situation. Meanwhile, children shouldkeep in touch with their parents to maintain a harmonious and warm familyhood. Besides, in view of the fact that most of the empty nesters have retired, it is meaningful for them to take up some activities such as traveling, hiking, reading rather than being trapped in the empty nest.

","My View on Package Traveling

As the New Year and Spring Festival approach, many people couldn't resist the temptation of touring during the holidays. When finalizing the traveling schedule, the majority of them would turn to travel agencies for help.

Choosingtravel agencies would make the whole trip economical because all the members travel as a whole and they may share the expenses of transport, accommodation and meals. There is no need for each one to rent a van and most hotels, bus companies and restaurants would make more discounts for package travelers than individual travelers. Besides, package traveling aimsat convenience so that travel agencies would prepare everything in advanceto make the whole trip easier and simpler. All the information they have accumulated serves as invisible tips and could help visitors get the most out of their tour. What's more, package traveling provides travelers with more chances to make friends and adds more joys to the whole trip.

Nonetheless, I am still in favor of self-service traveling even though package traveling is the mainstream option, because we may easily find the shortcomings of the latter. For instance, in order to keep pace with the whole group, an individual member sometimes has to give upvisiting his favorite spots and scenic sites. By contrast, self-service traveling wouldenable us to fully enjoy the sightseeingas long aswe prepare in advance, gather necessary information and make a detailed plan.

","Self-service Travel

Nowadays,self-service travel is becoming a trend among young people. It is a new way of getting outside in which travelers themselves arrange travel matters including time, route, and how to use money, etc. without the help of guides.

Self-service travel has both advantages and disadvantages. The benefits are as follows. To begin with, most of the young people dislike being restricted and self-service travel can provide them with more space and freedom. Moreover, self-service travel gives young people a good chance to improve their abilities to live independently. It helps travelers make good use of money as well because the travel expenses are totally arranged by themselves.There are of course disadvantages.Self-service travel sometimes can be dangerous for young people if they go climbing or camping in some dangerous places like steep mountains without professional guides or training.Some young people were once trapped in remote mountains. Some even died by accident during their travel.

As far as I am concerned, self-service travel is my choice, because it is highly beneficial for us. For self-service travel, we must first collect useful information about the place we're going, make a travel plan and calculate expenses. All these preparation works help train our organizing ability and decision-making ability. Also we can enjoy scenery in places that tour groups may not go. I just want to remind self-service travelers that to stay safe, please get away from dangerous places.

","Should Parks Offer Free Admission?

It is advocated that parks should be opened free of charge as one of the policies intended to benefit the general public. Some argue that parks are essentially supported by public taxes, and should serve the public in return. Therefore, on no account should parks become commercialized.

However,other peopleworries that free admission to parks will create some potential problems. More visitors, it is feared, will be attracted than the parks can accommodate, especially on weekends and holidays. Theswarm of visitors is likely to spoil the beauty and tranquility there. Litter thrown by visitors will ruin the surroundings. Therefore, if the policy that parks should be opened free of charge is adopted, parks will be in a terrible mess.

As far as I am concerned, the potential problems should not prevent the public from enjoying free admission to parks. As long as effective measures are implemented, such problems can be solved. For instance, a restriction can be placed on the maximum number of visitors each day to avoid overcrowding. Another solution is to have more signs to remind visitors to be well-behaved. In addition, volunteers can also help to monitor the visitors' behaviors and to clean up the garbage on the ground. Through the proposals that I mentioned above, the policy that parks should offer free admission will be carried out successfully and smoothly.

Thanks to the decline in the price of mobile phones, they are no longer a luxury tocommon people. A great number of college students have bought mobile phones, and the number is still growing. So it becomes a common scene that students use mobile phones on campus. There is no denying that mobile phones bring them in closer contact with the outside world.

However, the use of mobile phones on the part of college students brings about some problems. To begin with, it will disturb other students when the phone rings unexpectedly in class or the user talks loudly over the phone in the presence of others.Then their studies are likely to be disturbed if they receive more phone calls and text messages than necessary or if theyhave access to the Internet via their phone. Moreover, students are financially dependent on their parents. The purchase and use of mobile phones may cause extra burdento their families.

Personally, I do not oppose college students using mobile phones. But I would like to point out that they should consider three factors before they rush to buy one. First of all, they should take into account whether they can afford a phone and the phone bills. Second, they have to make sure their studies won't be adversely affected. Finally, they shouldkeep in mindthe importance of good manners and observe public regulations when using mobile phones.

As celebrity culture has a greater influence on people's mind, and as the wealthy population is expanding in China, people are prone to focusing on enhancing their appearances. Recently, more and more college students stand in the line of cosmetic surgery, especially some seniors.

People hold different attitudes towardcosmetic surgery. Some people are of the view that the cosmetic surgery is the key to wealth and love for college students, because they could improve their appearances to find better opportunities at work and in marriage. Moreover, as the college students are approaching a highly competitive society, they regard appearance as a weapon and a means of power. However, others take an opposite stand, firmly believing that those who want to change their appearances fail to establish a system to evaluate themselves. Moreover, the surgery runs the high risk of failureand even causesdeath.

As far as I am concerned, I agree with the latter opinion. The beauty looked at with eyes does not last forever. Instead of concentrating on the appearance, we should concentrate on inner beauty. Although certain jobs dorequire physical beauty, there are many and maybe tremendous numberof jobs that need people who are specialized.

","Should Students Go Abroad to Study?

Nowadays, a growing number of students are planning to study abroad. However, people's opinionsare sharply divided on this issue. For example, my friend Jamesis studyingin the USA and tells me about his overseas life and study. According to him, there are many advantages. Firstly, studying overseas forces him to cope with everything by himself, and broadens his horizons as well. Secondly, this experience is conducive to a better career path in that it has developed both his abilities and personality. Last but not least, manydeveloped countries offer arelatively better education.

On the contrary, another friend of mine, Claire, never agrees with James. She claims that as we have never stepped on foreign lands, it is unwise to follow the trend blindly. Furthermore, the culture gap could not be ignored, which may create obstacles for cross-cultural communication. The more barriers one meets, the more discouraged one may become. In addition, the expenses are too high for most families.

As for me, I do not agree with either of them. With regard to James' opinion, I believe one's success lies in what one is striving for instead of where one is. I know some people who came back from abroad could not find a job while some others whoreceived educationathomehave succeeded in their own fields. Asfor Claire's opinion, I don't think it is wise to reject everything before trying and gaining a whole picture of it. We should believe in ourselves in dealing with what we may encounter.

The high fees for using the facilities are beyond the students' ability to pay.

In the past decade, there has been a growing number of college students who applied for the driver's license, and the majority of applicants have shifted from the seniors to the sophomores. It seems that owning a driver's license is one of themust-do thingsfor most of the college students.

There are many factors that lead to this phenomenon. In the first place, as an old saying goes, skill is never too much to learn. Given the fact that those who obtain comprehensive ability may win more chances and opportunities in the society, more and more students go after the driver's license. In the second place, thinking that they will be too busy toget a driver's license in their senior years, the majority of the students decide to get one in their junior years when they have more time and their schedule is relatively flexible. Lastly, with the improvement of people's living standard,more and morefamilies are capable of buying a car for their children, thus to have a driver's license is out of their practical need.

As far as I am concerned, first, sinceapplying for a license is time consuming, students should arrange their time properly so as not to interfere with their study. Second,as many college students are the potential drivers in the future, they should bear in mind that though a license gives them the legal right to drive, professional driving skillsare very important because driving is not only a skill but also a matter of safety.

In the past decade, more and moregraduates complained that theirstarting salary underwent a decline compared with that of those who graduated a year earlier. Consequently, as college students, we begin to worry about the prospect of salary after graduation.

There are many factors contributing to the decline of graduates’starting salary. The enlarging enrollment of college is the first one to blame. Since the enrollment rate of college climbedat 15-20% annually from 1998 to 2008, the number of graduates increased correspondingly. As a result, more andmore graduates flooded into the job market for limited job vacancies, offering the employers more options and resulting ina decline of fresh graduate' starting salary. Anyway ajob with lowstarting salary is better than nothing. Besides, lack of comprehensive knowledge and working experience is also an important factor. With the development of society, most of the companies need the employees who are capable of various skills such as foreign language, driving, computer manipulating, etc. However, the graduates are mainly armed with theoretical knowledge but lacking in practical skills and experience; therefore, low salary is unavoidable.

As far as I am concerned, the school authority should set a sustainable recruiting scheme rather than expanding blindly. Too many students will cause great pressure on maintaining the education quality as well as balancing recruitment and employment. Besides, college students should take advantage of the time to accumulate sufficient knowledge and practical skills. Whenthe two parties take effective measures together, the graduates wouldget out of this embarassing situations as quicklyas possible.

They maintain that forcing them to go to art classes will lay heavy burden on kids and restrict their freedom. This is not really good for their growth.

In spite of the possible benefits mentioned, I, like the latter, am strongly against it. For one thing, most kids are sent to art schools to learn things they are not even interested in. Consequently they will be reluctant to cooperate with the teachers, resulting only in the waste of time and energy. For another thing, it might deprive children of their pleasure to play after school. Faced with competition and contest for better universities, most children are buried in piles of homework.

According to Wikipedia, critical thinking generally refers to a higher-order of thinking that questions assumptions.It is a wayof deciding whethera claimis true, false or even partly true and partly false. Also describedas ""thinkingabout thinking"", critical thinking has become an important component in many professions. Despite that critical thinking ability is highly required in education,some students are always said to be less critical compared with their counterparts from a different educational background.

Two major factors may contribute to the lack of critical thinkingskills ofthese students. To begin with, let us take China, Japan, and Korea as examples, there has formed atradition that children could never be allowed to disobey their parents, teachers and authorities due tohistorical and political backgrounds. Additionally, the difference in education system could be another reason. Take the American way of teaching as an example, students in Americaare usually encouraged to discuss in groupsand challenge each other, thetutors or even the authorities, in which critical thinkingskillsare gradually cultivated. However, in most Asian countries, students are just the passive recipients rather than active learners. Once they have grown up in such restricted education system, it would be rather difficult to change the way they think.

Therefore, it is the primary concern for the students to increase the awareness of critical thinking. Besides, the education system should be reformed to get students fully involved in all inquiry processes like discussing, challenging the authorities and keeping asking why. Moreover, teachers'explorationon how todevelop students' critical thinkingskills should be another focal point inthe education system reform.

People are often heard to talk about e-books written by such famous writers as Hanhan or Mu Zimei. Actually, modern readers seem to spend more time on e-books than on traditional ones.

They claim that it is convenient to read on line as modern people have easy access to the Internet while having less and less time to frequent the bookstore. Besides, reading e-books saves money.

　　Personally, I believe that e-books cannot be a substitute for all traditional books. Although the former are more convenient and less expensive, they cannot compete with the latter in at least the following aspects. First, you can take a traditional book anywhere and read it anytime but you cannot always have access to the Internet. Secondly, a truly valuable book deserves a paper version for your computer may have the risk of breaking down.

","According to the Bible, it is the almighty God who gave names to everything he created: ""he named the light ‘Day' and the darkness ‘Night'"". In fact, a name is a word or phrase that man uses to denote and identify a specific person, place or thing. There is no inexorable correlation between the sign and ""the signified"". For this reason, some claim that names are not so vital as they are supposed to be. However, I am fully convinced that they are of great importance.

Take the name of a person as an example. It is known to all that a person's name is divided into two parts: given name and surname. The given name is the name our parents assign us. We ourselves might change it later in our life. Usually, when a name is given, it contains a lot of information. Say, ""li"" in the name of some Chinese females shows that we wish them to ""beautiful"" while ""wei"" in the names of some males reveals that we expect them to be ""great"" in their future life.

As to the surname or family name, it is even more important, so important that some people may sacrifice their life for it. Originally, man had no such a name. But ever since a certain name was given, each member of the family carries it wherever he goes. Rather than merely a sign, it is the root from which we can trace back to our ancestor, the tie that helps bind us to other members of the same clan, the dignity most people hope to live for.

Apart from the name of a person, that of a place or thing is also significant in that it embodies history and culture. All in all, though names are assigned artificially, man is not free when giving names. But God is.

"How to Improve Psychological Health

1） 学生心理健康的重要性

2）学校应该怎样做

3）学生自己应该怎样做
","Students' mental health has been playing an increasingly important role in our day-to-day life. Indeed, it is widely accepted that it has gained growing popularity among persons in all walks of life. There is a general discussion today about the issue of disorder in brains.

Obviously, it is necessary that effective actions should be taken to prevent problems. Authorities in universities play a critical role in the situation. To begin with, schools, such as colleges or universities, can provide chances for the young men to ease their attention. What's more, some are physically strong, but psychological problems are able to bring potential threats. Teaches may have a chance to find them in advance. Besides, specialists in this field are to be required to make full preparation for cases in time. Facing the crisis, experts can deal with it in a professional way, which means they have more or better opportunities to save us than others.

From the factors mentioned above, we may safely draw the conclusion that we can free ourselves from mental illness by taking certain precautions. For example, if you have pains or puzzles in mind, finding a friend to express these is a good way to release pressure. Certainly, there is little doubt that further attention will be paid to the issue.

","The Certificate Craze

Recently the phenomenon of certificate craze has become a big concern of the public. It is also a new craze in the university, which seems like a routine activity on campus, for certificates do play a vital role when students look for a decent job.

Admittedly, there are different purposes behind this phenomenon. Some people aim at certificates because of the employment pressure. With the admission expansion of colleges, a great many graduates have to face the fierce competition in the job market. So it is the certificates that can make them more competitive. Also, some others consider all the diploma and certificates important standards by which a person's ability can be measured. They spare no effort to get the certificates for the sole purpose of proving that they are qualified in a certain field. Moreover, there are those who just want to enrich their lives by preparing for the certificates because they really enjoy their progress.

From my point of view, we should be more rational when it comes to certificates, since certificates do not necessarily prove one's ability. Being crazy in getting certifications blindly is nothing but wasting time. To conclude, we should focus on improving our ability but not merely getting a certificate.

It is no wonder that the university rankings become prevalent in our country overnight. For example, universities are used to being measured by scale, academic achievements or teaching faculty. Facing so many dazzling university rankings, both parents and students can't help asking themselves whether it is necessary to judge our advanced education with so complex standards.

The different voices are widely heard in our society. Supporters vote for the university rankings with their excuses that university ranking plays as an essential criterion for rating their academic level and also does contribution to the sensible selection of universities for most college-students-to-be. Surely, those who disagree the university ranking criticize its ambivalence and disorder.

As far as I am concerned, only if the criteria of judgment are objective and inclusive is it more advantageous to make university rankings, which can promote the academic level and provide a scientific channel for university authorities to know better about themselves. Besides, students also can make use of university rankings to gather more effective information on their desirable universities. Although I stand on the same side of university rankings, I will not hesitate to say ""no"" to all fraud in these ranking.

My dear friends,
Thanks very much for attending the speech. At first, I want to say “welcome to our university”. And I really feel honored to be here giving you some guidance on how to spend a meaningful university life. Hopefully, it will help.
As is known to all, university provides you with abundant knowledge in specific fields, shape enquiring minds and establish solid foundations for your future development. Even though some students may be surely aware of this, they also lose themselves sometimes. Some may fail in several exams and will not graduate from university on time; some may find a steady job upon graduation, only to be frustrated in the life. So, how to live a meaningful university life?
First, you should set up a clear goal, both professionally and personally, to give you a clear picture of the priorities in your university life. Then, take actions. If you want to pursue further studies, pay special attention to all the subjects in your major. And if you just want a job, do research on what qualifications to be needed for that particular job. What’s more, do make several good friends and take part in activities and physical exercises with them. Meanwhile, talking with parents, friends, teachers and even consulting professionals will be helpful to some confusions, frustrations as well as misunderstandings you have at universities.
By setting up goals and striving for them, I wish every one of you a happy and meaningful life here. Again, thanks for your coming!

Keeping a diary in English is one of the effective ways to improve our English writing ability. Compared with other forms of writing, it is shorter and takes less time. It can help us to cultivate the habit of thinking in English. If we persist in his practice, gradually we’ll learn how to express ourselves in English.
In keeping a diary in English, we inevitably run up against a lot of difficulties. In the first place, it often happens that we have trouble finding appropriate words and phrases to give expression to our mind. Secondly, there are many idiomatic ways of saying things in Chinese. And it is extremely hard for us to put them into English properly. Certainly, there are some other roadblocks we may come across in our keeping a diary in English.
As far as I’m concerned, my suggestion is that we should always have a note book and a Chinese-English dictionary within easy reach. Whenever something beats us, we can first put it down in our notebook and then consult our dictionary. We can also turn to our English teacher for help, if necessary. In short, it is of great use to keep a diary in English for the development of our writing skills. (209 words)

The direct victims of fake commodities are consumers. Consumers often buy fake commodities for their low prices, but they have to realize that these fake commodities are not only of low quality but also potentially harmful. Fake toys can cause accidents resulting in serious injury or even death. Fake commodities such as food and medicine may cause irreparable harm to the health of consumers. Fake commodities also harm society. If fake commodities prevail, manufacturers of authentic products will lose profits. This unfair competition will bring about market disorder.

Consumers should firmly say no to fake commodities. By rejecting fake products, consumers protect themselves in the long run. It is also the government’s responsibility to protect genuine commodities and crack down on fake ones.

They also list the advantages in terms of fraud prevention and network security protection. On the contrary, other people are concerned that if the real-name registration system is enforced, the freedom to conduct discussion and exchange of ideas online will be threatened. Another problem is that it is hard to protect a netizen’s right of privacy once their real identity is available on the Internet.

Drunk Driving is a very serious issue in China. In the first half of 2011, China’s drunk driving cases jumped by 9%. In Shenyang alone, 97 people were killed by drunk drivers by the end of July in 2011. The deadly result has sparked repeated crackdowns on drunk driving and heated debates on whether offenders deserve harsher punishment.

There are a number of reasons for the increase of drunk driving in China. Firstly, China’s highly sociable but sometimes excessive drinking habits should be mentioned. People often persuade others to drink more, even if they know their friends may drive when drunk. Secondly, the punishment for drunk driving is not harsh enough. Many people argue that the cost of drunk driving is too low, so drunk drivers do it again and again.

More severe punishment is definitely necessary to curb drunk driving. No matter who the driver is, or what the reason is, any drunk driver should be severely punished. But we need to also attach greater importance to education. Anyway, prevention is always the best measure.

　　There are two main reasons for college students skipping classes. First, compared with in middle school, students have more freedom in college. It depends more on one student’s consciousness whether he will attend the class. So those students lacking self-discipline begin to skip classes. Second, some teachers’ classes could not attract students’ interests so that some students would rather skip classes to study what they are interested in.

　　For whatever reasons, skipping classes does bring negative effects on students’ study. Therefore, it is necessary to take some effective measures to reduce this phenomenon.

Dormitory life is an indispensable part of college life. But sometimes the harmony in the dormitory can be disturbed in one way or another.

As is known to all, a harmonious dormitory life is important to college students and benefits all the members. On the one hand, we can have a good rest and put our heart into study. On the other hand, we will have a good mood and enjoy being together.

There are several ways to create and maintain a harmonious dormitory life. Firstly, you have to evaluate your life-style and try to get rid of your dirty habits, if there are any. Secondly, when an annoying situation arises, you’ll just have to learn to tolerate each other and co-exist. Thirdly, you’ll have to share with each other and make good friends.

In conclusion, we should try our best to build a harmonious dormitory life for the sake of good study and good life.

　　On the other hand, there are always some people who view this gap negatively. They believe that a lot of crimes happen as a result of this income gap. Some people make so little from their work that they risk taking criminal acts to get rich. In fact, experts have long found out that most cases of crime are directly related to low income. There is another point to back up a negative view against income gap. For most people, income gap may destroy the satisfaction that they obtain from work.

　　 As anything has two sides, so has the problem of income gap. Personally, I believe that this gap may motivate people to compete better in job market. When this gap is growing too wide, however, our government should make some policies to get rid of its negative consequences.

With the rise of people’s living standard, keeping pets is becoming a fashionable activity in China. More and more pet markets are set up across the nation, in which various kinds of pets are available. Over the past few years, even the prices of pets have been on the rise. Some people would spend several thousand Yuan on a smart dog or a rare bird. If you are strolling along the streets in the evening, you’ll see a lot of people walking dogs.

People keep pets for different reasons. For most families, pets are lovely, sensitive creatures with whom they are able to communicate. They keep them just for fun and pleasure. As for some adults, playing with their pets is their favorite form of relaxation after a day’s work. As for children, it seems that there are no better friends or companions they can find than a funny-looking dog or a clever cat. However, for some people, keeping pets is only a display of their wealth. By owning an expensive dog or bird, they intend to show off how wealthy they are.

I, myself, don’t see anything wrong with keeping pets. I think the love that exists betweenhuman and animals can be even more strongly felt while we are feeding a pet. It is this harmonious relationship between human and animals that contributes to the balance of nature.

","How to Reduce Stress

With the constantly changing and quickening pace of modern life. many people are used to rushing through their life. People have learned to take it for granted that the stress is and will be increasing all the time. A certain degree of stress can promote our study and work， but too much stress is certainly harmful，and sometimes may even cause serious mental and physical problems. So it is necessary to know how to reduce stress.

Stress can come from every direction. For instance，it can come from sorts of competition with other people. It comes when we have too many things to do and too little time to do it. It also comes when we do not have enough money to pay for what we want. It can also come when we lack confidence and admire others.

There are many ways that can help us solve this problem，but the following may be the most effective. First，we should make a practical judgment on our own ability and do what we can do. Don't set a goal that is too high because there are many things in this world that are beyond our reach. Second, we should learn to be considerate and tolerant. Do not try to change other people or other things. Everything has its own way in the world. Third, we'd better not-too-much keen on the material things. If you try to ""keep up with the Joneses""， you burden yourself with stress and can walk no longer on the road to happiness. Do not harbor any jealousy， vanity, or resent­ment to others. Be satisfied with what we have. Finally, we should keep frequent communication with our relatives and friends. Talk with them what we want and think of. Share with them our happiness and misery. This all will help us to feel better.

These are not necessary the only ways to deal with stress，and it is my hope that everyone can free from stress，both mentally and physically，and live a relaxed happy life.

Nowadays, there are still some students spending most of their time studying and having no hobbies. Fully engaged in academic work, those students have anything but spare time for physical exercise, relaxation and activities that match their interests.

Admittedly, by enrolling at college we have already made a commitment to study. However, college is a place to expand one’s knowledge and one’s interests. All work and no play is a sure recipe for unhappiness. Besides, we attend college not only to learn but also to explore. Making friends is one of the best things about college. If not taking time to socialize and meet new people in college, we may graduate with a straight A record only to find we’ve lost the best opportunity to make life-long friends and develop social communication skills. Last but not least, physical fitness is the prerequisite for a rewarding college life. If burnt out with heavy class load and homework, how can one lead an enjoyable and healthy life?

","Due Attention Should BeGiven to Spelling

Recently it often hits headlines of newspapers that some prestigious universities like Tongji exclude Chinese from the subjects to be tested in their practice of independent admission. This has aroused heated discussion among the public -- Is Chinese not so important as English? What if we neglect the study of our mother tongue?

First of all, globalization counts much for this phenomenon. In modern society, information in most media, be it the Internet or newspaper, is conveyed in English. As a saying goes, one can go to every corner of the world without any difficulty in communicating with local people. Unfortunately, while we emphasize the importance of English, we underrate the value of Chinese though China has been developing at an amazing speed.

But neglecting the study of Chinese is extremely harmful if the situation is left unfettered. The major harm is that China’s traditional value is likely to get lost because languageand ideas are interlocked in most cases. For example, when interviewed, most youngsters show that they are quite unfamiliar with some famous figures and their sayings.

To sum up, many reasons are responsible for the phenomenon and it will do us harm if we leave the situation as it is. Faced with the problem, we are expected to take effective measures. For one thing, the government should work out rules to ensure the time for the study of Chinese in school. Only in this way, can we find a cure for the problem.

","Sexual Discrimination in Job Markets

It is not uncommon that many companies even government offices prefer male candidates to female ones for their job vacancies, which has brought about a lot of complaints from women graduates saying that the hidden policy indicating sexual discrimination makes it rather hard to find satisfying jobs and therefore has violated their rights.

Many factors could account for the sexual discrimination in job markets. To begin with, the traditional view of women as a wife and a mother responsible for taking care of the whole family who tend to be both physically and mentally weaker than men is deeply rooted. For a long time has women been neglected as a working force. Moreover, certain jobs require higher abilities to adapt to frequent workplace changes even oversea working environment, which is believed to be a great challenge for most women employees by the senior managers or officials who make policies. Additionally, women staff is entitled to more paid holidays than men staff, namely, maternity leave for more than 3 months, which could possibly lower the working efficiency of the company. Consequently, women are not treated equal in job markets even they have the same or even better qualifications.

As far as I am concerned, although it sounds reasonable for the companies’ preference for men employees, women’s rights should also be guaranteed in the job markets. It is well suggested for the government to regulate the recruitment policy which emphasizes the qualification for a particular job rather than the gender difference. Meanwhile, employers could also make clear the bans and let future employees make decisions on the acceptance of the job instead of excluding all women candidates.

","The Way to Success

Success is something everyone looks for, longs for and dies for. And here comes our question, what is the way to success? Abraham Lincoln's famous remark that give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe, sufficiently reveal the essence of success. According to him, the secret of success lies in long-term preparation rather than reckless action.

In line with his claim, I strongly agree that long-term preparation plays a dominant role in obtaining success. Long-term preparation, which primarily consists of far-sighted planning and meticulous arrangement, can lay a solid foundation for success. In other words, long-term preparation as the groundwork opens the way to the ultimate goal.

History is laden with successful cases of great minds, like Thomas Edison and Mencius, whose primary concern is long-term preparation before reaching their most desirable goal. Without long-term preparation, they might have been nobody. Generally, they do not rush to success; rather, they patiently prepare, wait for the right moment until the opportunity comes.

Indeed, no one has the exclusive way to success. Abraham Lincoln's remark above is well indicative of the determining factor—long-term preparation. Where there is intensive preparation, there is a way.

I am writing to you to express my views and opinions upon the unsuccessful ban on the use of plastic bags in some regions. Though our government has officially enacted the law of restricting the use of plastic bags, people are still using them, which pollute our environment. How to solve this problem has become a hot issue in China.

To solve this problem, I would like to offer several suggestions. Above all, people should keep in mind the negative influence of frequently using plastic bags and gradually enhance their own environmental awareness. Besides, we should develop possible alternative forms to replace them, such as paper or cloth bags.

I am writing this letter to make some suggestions for improving the service of our university library. Although our library functions effectively in providing academic materials and enriching our campus life, its service goes far from being desired.

Firstly, why not arrange an inquiry desk at the circulation hall? With the help of a professional librarian, students can go through the procedures more efficiently.

1. The inevitability of sex education classes for all college freshmen.

2. The necessity of sex education classes for all college freshmen.

3. Conclusion.
","Sex Education Classes for All College Freshmen

The rapid changes in Chinese society also introduce a series of new social issues. Previous taboos, such as pre-marital sex and having multiple sex partners, seem to have disappeared in some segments of society. The government should mandate Sex Education classes for all college freshmen in one form or another.

There is a distinct lack of understanding among young college students in China of the consequences in engaging in this type of activity. Not only are they likely to lose self-respect for accepting a short-term sexual relationship as opposed a long-term marriage but the health issues for both partners are enormous. Most students are not even aware of proper methods of protection should they elect to engage in sexual activities. Hence, the incidents of unplanned pregnancy, most likely resulting in the female participate leaving university or terminating the pregnancy, Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDSare greatly increased. Students should be educated about the risks they take when they engage in this type of behavior and how to take proper precautions to reduce the risk of unplanned pregnancy, contracting STDs or even HIV/AIDS. It would not work for all, but even reaching a few students would be better than none.

As a nation which is moving so quickly, even issues which have in the past been neglected should be addressed. Students need to learn more about their own body, decide for themselves if they are ready for a sexual relationship but also be aware of the consequences of it. It is an issue that must be discussed for the sake of students and their future. Only through education can we trust the young people of China to make the right decision.

","As is vividly depicted in the picture above, within a stretching spider web, many people, old and young, men and women, are using the Internet in front of computers. Obviously, the spider web symbolizes the Internet and it is hard to say whether the Internet is making people closer to each other or making them farther away from each other.

The exaggerative and impressive cartoon has subtly revealed the duality of the relationship between man and the Internet. On the one hand, the Internet narrows the distance among people. With the development of science and technology, the Internet is currently one of the most efficient media used for interpersonal communi cation. We can a chieve an immediate communication via e-mail, QQ, MSN or ICQ. What's more, by using the Internet, we can get access to various information in the world without stepping out of our rooms. On the other hand, the development of computer science has given rise to some new problems. Some youngsters spend most of their time in front of computers, which will lead them into poor health. Moreover, many people are too addicted to the Internet to maintain face-to-face contact with their relatives and friends, which is unfavorable to the cultivation of people's ability to communicate with others.

From what has been discussed above, we can see clearly that it is necessary for us to use the Internet in a sensible way and restrain ourselves from addiction. After all, the Internet is invented to connect you and me, and to bring convenience to our lives rather than set a barrier to keep people from face-to-face contact. We need to spend more time communicating with each other face to face. Only in this way can we bring the Internet into full play.

","China is a country with a long history. It has many special traditions and customs. They are the nation's great treasures and we should do our best to preserve them. However, as China opens up to the world, more and more foreign ideas and products come into the country. How we take this western influence and what relationship should be established between the east and the west have become urgent questions for us to answer. For example, should we allow a coffee shop to be opened in the Forbidden City, a place which is thought to represent the essence of oriental life? Can the coffee shop integrate itself into the surrounding or will it form an eye sore?

In the cartoon we see a servant bringing a cup of coffee for the emperor. The joke is that the idea of emperor and the idea of coffee do not usually come together. It is funny to think of the emperor drinking coffee. But the cartoon may yet have another meaning. It implies that emperor, if he is still there today, will have learned to drink coffee. Modernization is a historical trend.

I believe that we should be open-minded about western influence. If it is good, we should not refuse it. A coffee shop in the Forbidden City will not pose any threat to our traditional culture. It will instead provide a convenient resting place for visitors who have to walk through the huge palace. The spirit of the 21st century is one of cooperation and coexistence. We should allow different cultures to exist together and flourish together.

","Water is probably the most important for life. If there is no water, there is no life. China has a large water resource amounting to 2,800 billion cubic meters, but we have a large population too, of 1.3 billion people. If we allocate the water to each person, then we must consider our country as poor in water resource. In the west of China where there is little rain all the year round, the earth is cracked or desertified. People have to walk miles every day to get water. They do not have enough water for drinking, for farming or for maintaining personal hygiene. Life is difficult for them.

Even in the east of the country where there is plenty of rain and there are a great many rivers and lakes, the situation does not offer reasons for optimism. Statistics show that 400 cities suffer from shortage of water and another 100 suffer seriously. Yet 50% of the rivers are polluted and waters around 90% of the cities are to some extent affected. This has posed a serious threat not just to our health, but also to our survival. The environment has worsened to an extent where we must do something about it.

We must raise public awareness of the water crisis. We should purify water and recycle water. We must close down water-polluting factories. As individuals we should use water- saving facilities at home and reuse water from kitchen for toilet. Everyone can do something to save water. If actions are not taken immediately, in 50 years wewill lack not only food, but water.

","Holiday-making has become a fashion. The Chinese government supports it because tourism is a big industry, bringing the country millions in revenue. During the long holidays of May 1 and October 1, billions of people are on the move. Not only are the holiday resorts full of people who seek a break from hard work, but also the places of historical interests are packed with visitors.

This is a good phenomenon and a sign that people's life is improving. What used to be a luxury for the rich and the fortunate is now within the reach of the majority. People are enjoying the pleasure of travelling and having their minds broadened at the same time. However, holiday-making has also created problems. As the cartoon shows, not all visitors are civilized or obeying the regulations. Some want to leave their signatures and inscriptions at the places they visit. Cases of damage to statues and historical structures are increasing. The Buddha who cannot bear the scratch and itch on his foot has expressed the feelings of all who are concerned with the protection of historical relics: we cannot bear such vandalist behaviors.

While we encourage tourism and the holiday culture, we must also take measures to safeguard our cultural heritage. We must educate holiday-makers and in the mean time place a heavy penalty on those who knowingly offend. After all we must leave our children what our forefathers have left us and leave it to them in good conditions.

","The cartoon describes a table tennis match. One player launches a good attack, but his opponent pulls the table away and the pingpong ball falls on the ground. The opponent wins, not by skill but by cheating. This cartoon reflects a general problem in the sports of today. Almost all Olympic Games are marred by scandals of drug abuse. Although the International Olympic Committee has forbidden the use of drugs and has implemented urine test and blood test, there are still athletes who take risks, counting on their luck to escape the tests. They use drugs to boost performance, to build muscles and to increase endurance.

Drug abuse,which is a kind of cheating, is probably the inevitable result of the change in the purpose of sports. Indeed, sports are not only related with friendship and fair competition, but also related with nationalism, with national anthems and national flags. People are encouraged not to appreciate individual's skills and strengths, but to support their national teams. Sportsare also related with personal success and money. If you win, you win fame and money. And for these, athletes will do anything, including cheating and taking drugs. This is a long way off the original aim of sports or Olympics, which is to improve health, promote cooperation and teamwork, provide enjoyment and increase friendship.

","Family planning is one of the basic policies of our country. It aims at controlling the fast growing population. By 2001, we already have 1.2 billion people, a number which is about to become too big for the country to support. In this circumstance, family-planning policy should be firmly implemented.But as we have more and more one-child households, family relations have changed. The only child in the family becomes the center of attention and his wishes are always obeyed. The cartoon shows that the child has become the head of the family while the grandparents, the traditional heads of the family, are reduced to the bottom of the hierarchy.

Too much care is no good for the child's healthy development. He or she will grow up to think thatthey arethe center of the society and that everyone should care forthem and obeytheir wishes. He or she will become selfish and self-centered. And a child growing up in a rich and sheltered condition will have little psychological strength for difficulties and failures. Problems like these have not yet received full attention from our society and our educational system.

I suggest that parents try to cultivate a balanced mind in their children. Parents should talk to their children about the problems they may have and let them understand what life is really like. They should try to teach their children to care for others andfoster a spirit of cooperation. Only in this way can theonly child grow up into a healthy adult.

2) explain its intended meaning, and then
3) give your comments.
","The drawing, which is a boiling hotpot, vividly captures a plethora of Chinese and western cultural ingredients encompassing literature, science, philosophy, the performing arts and so on. The illustrative line beneath the cultural ""hotpot"" describes it as both delicious and nutritious.

Evidently the cartoon focuses on the currently pervasive phenomenon of cultural integration. In today's world, no country can afford to live in isolation as all countries are becoming increasingly interconnected under globalization. On the one hand, as China opens wider to the outside world, it reaches out to and embraces various foreign cultures; hence, the traditional Chinese culture is on the way to becoming more diversified, vibrant and, of course, internationalized. An obvious—and worrying—sign is that many urban Chinese youth are becoming ""Westernized."" On the other hand, more and more people from other countries continue to be fascinated by Chinese culture, such as Peking Opera, Confucianism, Buddhism and the martial arts. The fact itself is eloquent proof that different cultures in the world are able to accept and respect each other.

In my view, any national culture is a precious heritage, and part and parcel of the human civilization. Since globalization is an irresistible trend, cultural integration contributes to mutual understanding and friendship among different nations. However, as we engage with a different culture, it is advisable that we ""absorb the essence and discard the dross,"" as the wellknown Chinese saying goes. Only in this way can we promote healthy cultural integration and development.

1) describe the drawing briefly,

2) explain its intended meaning, and then
3) support your view with an example/examples.
","This cartoon humorously presents a scene of a football game with the two rivals facing each other. The striker on one team is preparing to make a decisive shoot while the goalkeeper on the opposite team is posing for defense. However, under overwhelming pressure both of them are losing their confidence. The striker magnifies the goalkeeper in his mind so that chances of shooting in are slim. Likewise, the goalkeeper minimizes his own image as if he couldn't defend the goal successfully.

Apparently, the purpose of the picture is to emphasize the importance of self-confidence in our daily life. On account of the quickening pace of life, competition becomes increasingly fierce in all walks of life, imposing tremendous pressure on all individuals. The past few years have witnessed dramatic increase in the difficulty of examinations and employment. We must maintain strong self-confidence and optimism in the face of challenges so as to survive and succeed. Suppose we are inclined to overestimate our rivals or problems and neglect our ability, we will become hesitating and doubtful of ourselves, unable to fulfill even a simple task. Therefore, it is necessary to embrace the strong faith that we are indomitable and invincible.

I can think of no better illustration than the following one. Helen Keller was born deaf, dumb and blind, with certainly nothing to give her self-confidence. Nevertheless, she went on to conquer her multiple handicaps to finally become a writer and lecturer, to become an inspiration to all. This case effectively clarifies that no matter what tasks we are confronted with, we should never overestimate the difficulties or underestimate our abilities. As the saying goes, our only enemy is ourselves. Only by building strong self-confidence can we demonstrate grace under pressure and turn our dreams into reality.

","As is subtly portrayed in the drawing, two handicapped young men are heading towards their destination with vigorous strides, leaving all their crutches behind. On their journey, the hardship of disability is no longer an obstacle, and they support each other with firm hands and proceed steadily. The caption indicates that they can travel extensively with combined legs.

It is apparent that the cartoonist aims at reminding us of the importance of cooperation in our daily life. Hardly can anyone achieve success in his career without the assistance of his colleagues and partners. As competition in every walk of life grows increasingly fierce, we must defeat our rivals through powerful team work. Take basketball hero Yao Ming as an example, he can slam the dunk smartly because all his teammates contribute more or less to his outstanding performance. Likewise, the successful completion of Shenzhou 7 mission should be attributed to the Chinese scientists' joint efforts instead of individual accomplishment. If we work separately, we will be confined to vulnerable minds and limited resources.

On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we may draw a conclusion that cooperation and team work really count in this competitive society. Therefore, we should associate ourselves harmoniously with our companions in every attempt towards our goals. In addition, it is indispensable for us to train our kids frequently to interact smoothly with others in a team. As the saying goes, unity is strength.

The man in the left photo has Beckham, the name of an international football star, drawn on his face while the man in the right photo spends 300 yuan in having his hair cut in the same hairstyle as Beckham's. What is revealed in the photos is most thought-provoking.

These pictures, although a little exaggerating and satirical at first glance, can make us ponder: Why does this phenomenon appear? As is known to all, with the development of modern communications, more and more people are influenced by some so-called ""stars.""

Therefore, there are many fans who run after and imitate them—film stars, athletic stars, even stars of ""super girl"" singers. First, they do so because they admire them and want to obtain their fame and reputation. Second, although there is no denying the fact that some people do this out of pure admiration, yet, some just want to become wealthy overnight—without hard work, without sweat, just effortlessly.

In my view, the craze of blind idol worship should be taken into account by each responsible citizen of our society. On the one hand, a wholesome social environment must be shaped with the help of our government departments at all levels.

","Nowadays, pirate videos, tapes and software become increasingly common. They are available both on the streets and on the shelves of stores. In fact, they are so common that people are seldom aware they are illegal. In the picture, we see a man selling pirate CDs and VCDs. The two young people are looking at his wares and choosing what they want.

However, piracies are illegal and they violate laws on intellectual property rights. Piracy is a form of stealing. By duplicating intellectual products without permission from copyright holders, they steal the achievements of other people and reap the profits from other people's hard work. Pirate products encroach on the copyrights of the authors and producers. People who make pirate products are indeed thieves.

The prevalence of piracies also has negative effects on the development of industries whose copyrights need protection, most notably entertainment and computer software. Piracies disturb the normal order of the market. The extremely low prices are taking market share from the legal manufacturers of copyright products and therefore depriving industries of the fund to invest in new products. In the long run it affects the willingness and desire to produce new products and therefore affects the prosperity of the industry itself.

Protecting intellectual property rights is beneficial to the country and to consumers. The government should tighten laws and regulations to punish those who manufacture and sell pirate products. Ordinary people should not be blinded by short-term benefits of low prices and should firmly refuse piracies.

","Nowadays a considerable number of people, especially the young, have become obsessed with romance on the Internet. According to a recent survey, nearly half of our young people have experienced the so-called cyber romance or have shown great interest in it. In the picture, we see a young man sitting in front of his computer and imagining his ideal girl on the other end of the line. This phenomenon is quite common among our young people.

The pressure of the workplace has deprived young people of much chance of communicating with each other. It is hard for them to find true love in real life. So they turn to the Internet as a medium and fall in love with each other in this virtual world. Cyber-love seems to be more mysterious and exciting to those who like to try new things. They believe that they can have more excitement there than in the real world.

In fact, cyber-love is full of dangers and risks. For one thing, you do not know who you are talking to on the net. The beautiful girl you fancy very much on the net may be in real life an ugly old woman. The handsome young man you fall in love with may be in real life a married mid-aged person with a wife and a family. While you enjoy the Internet romance, you should expect to be disappointed in the end when you find out the truth.

Cyber-love is after all a form of fantasy. You are indulging in an illusion. Your beloved girl is created out of your own imagination. You idealize her and admire her. You talk very well with her on the net, but in real life you may feel that you cannot talk or you cannot find words to express your meaning. You may find out that you cannot get along with her at all. There is a great difference between the virtual and the real world.

Many people admit that they tell lies on the net. It's also reported that some criminals commit crimes there. Therefore, we should have a correct attitude towards the cyberspace. We should make proper use of the machines we created and not fall a victim to them.

The picture reveals a serious problem of our society: domestic violence. It is reported that domestic violence occurs in both cities and villages, in more or less the same way as the picture describes. Only rarely do we have a violent woman and a beaten-up man.

There are signs that this problem is becoming more and more serious. With the implementation of economic reform, an increasing number of men become rich and successful in their lives. As a result, their wives become more and more dependent financially. What is more, a lot of husbands hold the old idea that men are superior to women, and wives should completely obey their husbands. So whenever there is argument or quarrel, they settle it by violence. On the other hand, most women will do nothing after violence in order to avoid being laughed at or save their so-called face. They do not protect themselves with the weapon of law. Instead, they tolerate and keep silent, which undoubtedly encourages domestic violence.

It is high time that wetook actions to end this crime. The whole society should condemn domestic violence and the government should pass laws to to prevent domestic violence and punish those violators.

Since China adopted the reform and open policy, more and more rural workers are leaving the underdeveloped rural areas to seek temporary jobs, mostly physical, in the cities. They eat plain food, inhabit shabby shelters, and get low pay and no respect. They are regarded as transients in the cities and are even considered the most wretched people in China. They also suffer from discrimination by city dwellers and various forms of exploitation by some employers. In a word, the problems of rural workers haunts the development of modern China.

To me, rural workers accelerate the economic development of the cities because they can provide abundant and low-cost labor, increase consumption and spur competition in the labor market. What the government should do is to provide pensions, unemployment insurance and other necessary benefits to them to guarantee a fair distribution of urban resources.

","In China, more and more people are coming to the city from the countryside to make their fortune. You can see peasant workers almost everywhere. As the graph shows, City S had only 20,000 peasant workers in 1980. By 1990, this number grew to 100,000 and by 2000 it had reached 280,000. This caused a great increase in the city's population. I believe the same thing is happening in other Chinese cities as well.

It is probably a good thing for country people to leave their land to come to the big cities. It relieves pressure on the land and it is extremely good for the places where there are too many people for the work available. However, as more and more people move to the city, it creates a bigger problem than the city can cope with. In places where there have already been problems of housing, unemployment and food supply, this massive increase in the size of towns places a tremendous strain on the city government. The population is expanding at such a rate that it makes the normal planning of the town impossible. The results are over-crowdedness and slums. Moreover, it is generally the young and active members of the population who tend to move, leaving the old people, the children and the infirm to run the farms, which is hardly likely to improve the efficiency. This might cause a decline in rural industries and food supply.

It is perhaps hard to say urbanization is a good thing or a bad thing. But one thing is certain: If we narrow the gap between the city and the country and diminish poverty in the poor areas, people will live a prosperous life everywhere.

","Cheating on Exams

It seems that cheating on exams has a long history. From the picture, we can see that all kinds of cheating on exams have been existing since ancient times. People might cheat by writing on a big piece of clothes, on a small paper fan, or even by printing thousands of Chinese characters on a narrow ruler. While we are amazed by the ancient people's intelligence, we are shocked by modern technology used in cheating on exams, such as mobile phones and ear-phones. In fact, cheating is becoming prevalent and seems to spread quickly on campus.

People may wonder why cheating is so hard to prevent. On the one hand, our attitudes towards marks should be responsible. Most people, especially parents and teachers, judge students by their marks. In their minds, high marks mean everything—brightness, ability and a prosperous future. On the other hand, students also place much weight on marks. If they get low marks, they are often considered to be less able and less intelligent. So it's not surprising that students regard exam as the most important thing in the world. In order to get high marks, some of them can't help taking the risk.

Whatever the reasons, measures should be taken to stop cheating on exams. First of all, parents and teachers should take their responsibility in preventing cheating. They should not regard tests as the only way to measure the students. Encouragement and education would be more effective in preventing cheating than criticism and punishment. Furthermore, students who cheat also have to change their attitudes. They should learn to be more confident and convince themselves that they can pass exams without cheating. They should also realize that it might be easy to cheat on a test, but it will be hard to cheat in their jobs where real knowledge is required. Actually, cheating is morally wrong, but there's still a long way to go before we can eliminate this common phenomenon.

","This cartoon symbolically describes how the parents and grandparents cherish, love and place at the center of their attention their child, the only child of the family. Like the sun, the center of the universe, the only child is surrounded by his or her parents and grandparents, who are like the planets revolving around the sun. They are willing to do everything to please or even indulge this child.

The picture illustrates a common phenomenon to be seen in China today. Most Chinese couples today are only allowed to have one child according to the Chinese family planning policy. Therefore this child, boy or girl, naturally becomes the apple in the parents' and grandparents' eyes. They will spare no effort in satisfying every need of the child, the so-called “little emperor.""

As far as I am concerned, this practice will not benefit the child's mental well-being in the long run. Instead, it brings a negative influence on the child's ability to cope with adversities when he grows up and enters the society. The result is that the child is as fragile as a flower growing in a greenhouse, unable to tackle hardships and setbacks in this harsh world. The right thing to do is to care, to guide and to love the only child within a reasonable limit; let the child grow naturally and healthily.

","Nowadays, one of the most serious problems for Chinais the growth of its population. It is illustrated by the graph that China's population has reached 1.3 billion. It is also reported that the number will keep increasing in the coming years.

As the problem remains, some consequences may naturally follow. For one thing, the rapid growth of the population has caused great pressure on the supply of food, water, fuel and housing, and has consequently brought about a lot of problems to both the society and the people's life. For another, the large population has led to widespread unemployment in cities and, as a result, the society is facing much more instability. Finally, the large population has also caused continuing poverty in densely populated areas, and has made it harder for children from poor families to receive education.

It is obvious that the rapid growth of population should be controlled by the government. To solve the problem, both the government and the general public should make greater efforts. The government should do more to implement the family planning policy. The public should be informed about the serious problems caused by large population.

","Act According to Actual Circumstances

As is vividly depicted in the cartoon above, a stout customer holds a small piece of cloth as the tailor carefully measures. Funny as it may seem, this cartoon is very thought provoking. The implied meaning of the cartoon can be stated as that one needs to consider the actual circumstances when pursuing a goal. Merely acting on one's desires while ignoring the facts can hardly lead to success.

The message carried by the cartoon points to the importance of rational thinking. A case in point is the fact that currently there are more graduates than jobs. Every year, many college graduates fail to find suitable positions. The reasons are mainly twofold: on the one hand, there are simply not enough opportunities to accommodate such great number of graduates; on the other hand, inappropriate individual assessment constitutes an even bigger obstacle. In many cases, aiming too high without taking one's advantages and disadvantages into consideration directly leads to the setbacks in the job market.

In my opinion, to set a realistic target for one's future, one must make rational decisions and make preparations accordingly.

","Fresh Water Supply

What are the prospects of China's fresh water supply in the coming decades? Let's take a look at the figures in the graph. China had just enough fresh water in 2000. But, with population increase and economic development in the coming decades, the gap between demand and supply of fresh water will be widened: roughly a shortage of 30billion cubic meters in 2010, of 35billion cubic meters in 2020 and of 150billion cubic meters by the year of 2030.

What are the causesof the insufficiency of fresh water? Firstly, ecological change, particularly in northwest China, has brought about long spells of drought.Moreover, in dry seasons, many people in the drought-stricken areas could barely find drinking water for themselves and their livestock. Secondly, water pollution makes fresh water undrinkable or even poisonous. Thirdly, the growing population consumes more fresh water than ever before.

Facing the increasingly serious shortage of fresh water, both the government and the citizens should take effective measures. The government should establish rules to improve the ecological environment. Factories that drain polluted water into rivers and lakes should be severely punished or fined, and deadline should be set for them to build water purifying facilities. We must economize our use of water, speed up water price reform and establish a fair and sustainable price system. Last but not least, birth control policy should be more strictly pursued, particularly in densely populated areas and rural areas.

","China and Gold Medals at Olympics

As is vividly described in the chart above, the number of gold medals snatched by China has been climbing and rocketed to 32 at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games. This is a great achievement and new record in the history of Chinese sports.

The major reasons for the great achievement revealed in the chart above can be illustrated as follows. To begin with, the reform and open policy has contributed to the growth of Chinese sports. The practice of the reform and open policy since 1978 has greatly improved Chinese economy, which has laid a solid foundation for the development of sports in China. Thus, without this, the 32 gold medals would have been a pie in the sky. What's more, the international exchanges have brought about the growth of Chinese sports. On one hand, we sent Yao Ming to play NBA and Liu Xiang to participate in all kinds of international sports events; On the other hand, we have invited foreign professionals to come to China and coach our national teams. Without the international exchanges, the 32 gold medals would have been a pipe-dream.

","The Increase of MA/MS Candidates

As is vividly portrayed in the chart above, the number of MA/MS candidates has been on the rise over the past years and amounted to 1.3 million in 2005.

The foremost reasons for the great increase of MA/MS candidates can be illustrated as follows. In the first place, the idea that knowledge is power has contributed to this increase. At present, we are living in an era of knowledge explosion. If we want to survive in the current society, we must have good command of knowledge. In a sense, learning has become a life-long work. Therefore, more and more people are not content with their four-year college education and apply for MA/MS degrees. In the second place, the fierce competition in the job market has resulted in the great increase. At the moment, the supply of the college graduates overtakes the demand for them. As a result, many college graduates can not find jobs they really enjoy and want. Some of their jobs are even irrelevant to their majors. Therefore, they would like to further their study instead of doing the work they dislike. Consequently, more and more people apply for MA/MS degrees and this has led to the great increase of MA/MS candidates.

In my view, the increase of MA/MS candidates means more competition in the entrance exam for postgraduate studies; however, it also indicates that people's educational level will be greatly enhanced, which will benefit the country in the long run.

In recent years, China has experienced a dramatic advancement in aeronautics and astronautics. As is revealed in the table above, Shenzhou Series Spaceflight Missions have been consecutively and successfully carried out over the period from 1999 to 2005. This has inspired every Chinese both at home and abroad.

Firstly, the reform and open uppolicy has greatly improved our national economy, which has laid a solid foundation for the development of science and technology including aeronautics and astronautics. Secondly, this shows that China's science and technology have reached the advanced world level. The construction and launch of space vehicle depend on the technical support from such disciplines as materials science, biology, communications, meteorology and astronomy. The successful launch of Shenzhou VI has proved that the comprehensive capability of China's science and technology is of world class.

In my opinion, the prospect of China is sure to be more promising. On the one hand, our government will put more stress on the development of science and technology.

","More Scholars Return from Overseas

As is clearly portrayed in the chart above, the number of scholars returning from overseas kept increasing over the past years and rocketed to 50,000 in 2004. People may wonder what is behind the amazing figure.

The foremost reasons for the tremendous increase can be illustrated as follows. To begin with, a set of preferential policies has contributed to the increase of the number. To attract the students studying overseas to return, our government has set up some preferential policies in terms of salaries, housing, choice of jobs, and children's education. Without these policies, the increase of the number is out of the question. What's more, the rapid development of our motherland has led to the increase of the number, too. Thanks to the reform and open policy, China's robust economy has laid a solid foundation for the rapid development of science and technology, which makes China a most inviting country to both Chinese at home and abroad and foreigners. Therefore, without the great leap of our motherland over the past years, the increase of the scholars returning from overseas would be impossible.

In one word, our preferential policy and rapid development of our motherland are the root cause of the increase revealed in the chart above. We should try every means to attract more scholars to return so as to make more contributions to our motherland.

As we all know, ""Haste makes waste."" The fisherman shows us a vivid example. However, the kind of mistakes which come from haste are not unusual. We all may have had such an experience.

Being out of breath you sat down in the classroom and felt happy that finally you were not late. Next, unfortunately you found that you had forgotten to bring the textbook.

Similarly, when a good opportunity appears, some people will be too excited to think clearly and design a plan cautiously. As a result they may ignore the disadvantages of the matter, and then may be frustrated and even end up with trouble.

","Education: Quality-Oriented or Examination-Oriented

As we all know, from elementary school to college and university, all students, teachers and parents are struggling for higher scores. The reason is that the current education system does not aim at students' quality. Instead, it is solely concerned about students' ability to perform better on the examination and their ""skills and techniques"" for taking a test. Consequently, many students, even those with higher scores, often perform poorly when it comes to the practical application of knowledge they have learned in class.

For a long time China's education has been examination-oriented. Very little attention is paid to cultivating their creativity. As a result, schools are training those students who can only learn by rote. The defects in the system prevent students from developing their intellectual, moral and even physical abilities. Therefore, as the picture shows, our country is challenging examination-oriented education by advocating a quality-oriented one. The latter will focus on the students' ability and quality as a whole. What's more, the examination results will no longer play an important role in evaluating the students' academic achievements.

Some firmly believe in the magic force of the new education policy and eagerly look forward to enjoying the great benefits the program will bring about. The students will have a colorful life, a freer environment, and of course, a more creative mind. It goes without saying that, our education system will not be making a ""robot"" out of a student, but brings up a new generation that are masters of the robot.

旅程之“余”
","As is vividly depicted in the drawing, two young tourists on a sightseeing boat are throwing waste into the lake, which is unfortunately already covered with various floating rubbish like plastic containers, food wrappings, etc. The caption below the picture says: Leftovers of Traveling.

From the picture, we can conclude that the painter wants to convey such a message: an increasing number of tourists are unaware of their environment-polluting behavior causing the deterioration of our environment. Nowadays, tourism, an engine of economic growth, is booming everywhere. On the one hand, governments at all levels are sparing no effort to improve our environment to attract more tourists both at home and abroad, thus promoting the development of tourism to a large extent. On the other hand, the inappropriate behavior of tourists, such as littering and spitting, is causing severe environmental problems. If we leave it as it is, the nature will take revenge on human beings sooner or later.

In my view, countermeasures should be taken to prevent the environmental pollution caused by bad behavior. First of all, laws and regulations should be implemented to ban bad behavior. In addition, a nationwide educational campaign must be launched among the general public, especially the young, to raise their awareness of environmental protection. Only by making concerted efforts can we soon embrace a clean and sustainable environment.

"@@Advantages and Disadvantages of Studying Abroad@@
","Advantages and Disadvantages of Studying Abroad

Some people believe that attending a college or university in a foreign country has many advantages. They think this can help them learn more than they can from universities in their own country, especially when they go to a developed country where they can catch up with the pace of scientific and technical advance of the world from that country's modern lab facilities. In addition, they can pick up the latest developments of the living language there more quickly, develop their ability of coping with the routine matters such as finding a part-time job, renting a house and helping with the housework, and learn many new things to widen their views and broaden their minds.

But some people don't agree to it. They think that attending a college or university abroad also has many disadvantages which outweigh the advantages. They hold that students studying in a foreign country will have more difficulties in both life and study. The most serious problem is the language barriers. They have to spend much time learning a foreign language and even if they have learned the language, they still can't understand thoroughly what the foreigners and teachers say just because of the unfamiliar culture background and social customs. So if they are not persons full of courage, flexibility, and determination, they are most likely to fail and learn nothing eventually. Besides, since costs and expenditure are much higher than those in their native country, most overseas students have to work for a living, and will find it impossible for them to pay all attention to studying. So it is of benefit to them if they study in their own country.

The above two viewpoints, I should say, are all reasonable in some respects. But I support the first group of people. Students should attend a college or university in a foreign country if they can. In this way they can learn not only the useful knowledge of science but also the culture and customs of other nations. Besides, they can learn new ideas, bring in fresh air in our way of thinking and contribute more to the development of our country.

"@@An Electronic Dictionary or a Traditional Paper One@@

Some students like to use electronic dictionaries in their study of English. Others think the traditional paper dictionaries are more advantageous. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each kind, and explain which one you prefer to use.
","An Electronic Dictionary or a Traditional Paper One?

Dictionaries play a very important role in language study. When it comes to whether to choose an electronic dictionary or a traditional paper one, different people will offer different opinions. Though electronic dictionaries are more popular now and often quicker and easier to use, traditional paper dictionaries are a better tool for study, especially of a foreign language.

Traditional dictionaries, by providing more detailed definitions and examples, have greater capacity of vocabulary and can better serve us for study purposes. Some famous publishing houses have issued a lot of authoritative dictionaries, like Oxford and Webster. By contrast, electronic dictionaries do not necessarily provide enough detail to provide accurate information. Though paper dictionaries are generally much heavier than electronic ones, students can use them at any time and in any place because they do not rely on electricity. Though the size of the letters in some paper dictionaries is very small, it does not consume energy unless some count the energy a person uses to carry it around! Think of all the money people could save on batteries, too! When people travel, an electronic dictionary may be more convenient. However, if somebody wants to read a book in a foreign language, a traditional dictionary is a perfect tool. Paper dictionaries are not merely a tool to check the meaning of words, but also a book which can be used to enlarge your vocabulary.

From the above, we can see that a paper dictionary is a better tool for us to study, so, in the long run, I prefer paper ones to electronic ones.

"@@Living on Campus or Living Outside School@@
","Living on Campus or Living Outside School?

Nowadays, choosing a right living place becomes an important issue for college students. Some of them prefer to live alone by renting a room near school, while others prefer to live with classmates on campus. As for me, I like to live with classmates in group dormitory on campus. There are several vital reasons for my opinion.

First, it is very convenient to ask classmates questions about courses and have various discussions with them. The main task of students is to achieve outstanding academic performance rather than anything else. Living on campus benefits not only me but also my classmates as we can help each other. Second, it can make me have better personal relations. It is not enough to communicate with classmates and friends just in classroom. Instead, we need see and talk to each other frequently in spare time so as to maintain friendship. Third, it can save me much time. Living outside school will absolutely take me more time to go to classes and get back. Put all the wasted time together, that is really a considerable amount. With the saved time, I can study longer to improve my GPA. Meanwhile, I can also participate in more association activities in order to make new friends and enrich my school life.

In conclusion, living on campus is the best choice for college students. It helps them to perform better in study and establish better personal relations. Contrarily, living off campus would produce adverse impact and therefore should be avoided.

"@@The Best Way of Reducing Stress@@
","The Best Way of Reducing Stress

Stress is one of the biggest enemies for a modern person. Different people have different ways to beat stress, and my remedies depend on the type of pressure I have. Usually the most common stresses I encounter are related to work, friends and myself.

The way I deal with work-related stress is to stop working for a while. If I find myself getting tired of the work, I would stop and talk to my colleagues for a while. And then I will get back to work again with enthusiasm. And when I encounter stress brought by my friends, I often talk about the problem with them openly and work out a solution together in an honest way. Through this way, I can mostly be understood by my friends and our relationship will probably turn out to be better than before. The last type of stress is actually caused by myself. If I feel exhausted and anxious about my future, I would adjust myself and tell myself that I can do my best. Sometimes, I would ask for advice from my friends. And often, their encouragement helps me re-establish confidence and support me to go further.

Conclusively, my ways of reducing stress are relaxing myself, talking about it with friends and facing it. It's by these methods that I can maintain physical and spiritual health, and keep good relationships with others.

"@@Being an Only Child Is More Advantageous@@
","Being an Only Child Is More Advantageous

More and more people are concerned with the number of children in a family. From my point of view, being an only child offers more advantages than disadvantages.

In comparison with the life shared with siblings, the life of being an only child has four obvious advantages. Firstly, the child enjoys the privilege of being the center of attention and can get all the love and care of the parents. Secondly, the parents are usually able to satisfy all the material needs of the child. Thirdly, the child is completely free from the possible conflicts often found in a big family. Lastly, because of lack of mutual help and because the parents cannot be with the child all the time, the child is likely to develop an independent character that will enable him or her to succeed more easily in society.

Although the disadvantages of being an only child are also obvious, such as the lack of playmates at home and the possible overindulgence in some cases, it seems to me that being an only child is more advantageous.

"@@The Popularity of Western Holidays@@
","The Popularity of Western Holidays

It seems that some Western holidays are getting more and more popular in China. For example, weeks before Christmas, countless shops, restaurants and hotels have got ready with Christmas decorations. However, certain traditional Chinese festivals are being neglected.

In fact, the Western festivals are celebrated in China quite differently that from in the West. For example, Christmas in the Western world is mainly a spiritual festival. Then why have the Western holidays taken root in China? The chief reason is that businessmen know that they can make money by producing holiday goods or encouraging extra dining and celebrating.

I think the popularity of Western holidays does indicate the success of the economic reform. Certainly economic development has brought extra money to many people in China, but we shouldn't waste our money on useless things. We should not be led by those businessmen, rather, we should take the opportunity to relax and enjoy ourselves. Remember, holiday means happiness, not spending.

"Some people say that learning is mainly from books, while others say that learning is from experience. Write your opinion and prove your idea. You should supply an appropriate title for your composition.
","Learning Is Mainly from Experience

There has been much talk recently about whether we should learn from books or learn from experience. Some people think that learning from experience is more important while others hold the different opinion. Personally, I side with the former, in the belief that experience is the best teacher.

Admittedly, learning from books, as advocated by many, has its active role to play in our academic life. It can put us in touch with the great minds and arm our heads with massive knowledge. However, there are numerous merits for learning from experience, too. First things first, experience is the source of knowledge and understanding as well as meaning. Nowhere can the importance of learning from experience be described so vividly and accurately as in the old saying—""Nothing ever becomes real till it is experienced "". Take the human progress as an illustration. Dating back to hundreds of thousands years ago, we human beings were utterly ignorant. But by incessant practices, our ancestors accumulated massive experience, from which they acquired a great amount of knowledge, transforming our world from a primitive society into a highly-developed one. Second, unlike the theories recorded in books, experiences can apply to practical use. When we are at work, what we need is the experience of practical application instead of the abstract theories in our books.

Taking all these into account, we can draw a conclusion that learning from experience is more important than learning from books. Always remember the old saying given by Einstein—""The only source of knowledge is experience "".

"@@My Idea on Part-time Jobs@@

From today on, students are going to have summer vacation. Many of them are planning to do a part-time job during the summer. What are your ideas and suggestions as to what jobs they should do and how many hours they should work each day?
","My Idea on Part-time Jobs

In the modern society social experiences are very essential to one's success to a great extent, and part-time jobs just provide students the opportunity to go into the outside world.

By doing a part-time job, students can obtain the sense of independence and social responsibility. In the meanwhile they can develop their interpersonal skills that cannot be easily gained in school. In addition, it is a good way to cultivate one's frugality and to make one realize the value of money. In the long run, students graduating from universities or colleges will inevitably be confronted with fierce competition, and part-time jobs can function as a preparation for the future career and a practice for one's ability to survive various challenges. More importantly, it gives students an opportunity to explore the real social implication of politeness, cooperation, compromise, decision making and so on in real life.

However, part-time jobs may interfere with students' scheduled time and affect their study. So it is hoped that they do not work long hours so as to minimize the side effects of doing a part-time job. Generally speaking, if one can strike balance between a part-time job and school work, it is advisable to try their hand outside school campus.

","Chinese Tree Planting Day

Planting trees is very important for a country. China has set its Tree Planting Day which falls on March 12th. On this day, thousands of trees will be planted on the hill, by the river or in other places.

Spring is the best time to plant trees because it's warm and the ground is exactly ready. Many cities, big or small, have established urban greening and tree planting programs. Consequently, environment in dozens of big cities have been upgraded. Chinese government has provided grants to help hundreds of small towns with their tree planting plans. Planting trees may improve air quality, curb sand storm, and contribute to local economic development. Besides, trees provide a habitat for birds and other animals.

Now the total area of forest in our country is shrinking and at the same time wood is in huge demand in the market. To make matters worse, some people destroy precious forests for their own interests. Therefore it is both important and urgent to plant trees and protect the hard-won forests. We should make everyone realize that trees are part of environment and part of our life.

The campaign of planting trees can have a profound long-range impact on a community and its inhabitants.

"@@Whether Private Cars Should Be Encouraged in China@@

A meeting is held to discuss whether private cars should be encouraged in China. You are invited to give your suggestions.
","Whether Private Cars Should Be Encouraged in China

A private car is very important nowadays in people's lives. I maintain that there are many advantages in possessing a car.

First, a car allows an individual to move around conveniently because they can reach their destination directly. Second, driving a car is a comfortable way to travel from place to place since it creates a greater sense of freedom and privacy. With a car, people can go wherever they like and save their precious time for waiting for a bus or tube. Besides, automobile industry provides many jobs for people.

However, others strongly object to developing private cars. They hold that as more and more cars are manufactured and put on the street, a large amount of poisonous gas will be given off, polluting the atmosphere and causing severe harm to people' health. Moreover, private cars contribute greatly to traffic congestions.

On considering both sides, I tend to conclude that the advantages of owning a private car outweigh the disadvantages. Therefore, China should increase its output of automobiles and further stimulate the private car market.

"Now in China, college students need to pay for their education. Give your comment. You should supply an appropriate title for your composition.
","Chinese College Students ShouldPay Their Tuition

I strongly maintain that Chinese college students should pay their tuition. Paying tuition is a major step in China's educational reform. Though university tuition rose some 50 percent this year compared with that of 1999, most parents firmly support it, believing that their children will enjoy a much brighter future after graduation. In fact, most Chinese families could afford the rising cost for higher education.

Chinese government used to cover all expenses of college students and assign jobs for them. But under those circumstances only a small number of high school graduates could go to universities. To enroll more candidates into universities calls for huge government investment, which is out of the question given the status quo. Consequently, universities began to charge the students in an effort to make up for huge investment. More students then have the chance to pursue their higher education after high school. And the learning and living facilities have also beenimproved.

However, poverty-stricken families are under extreme pressure. The growth rate of the tuition fees is much higher than that of their income. Subsidies are expected to come from the government and society.Anyhow, students have the right to choose whether to go to university for further study or to start working after high school graduation.

As for me, I agree that the students should pay their tuition.

It is easy and comfortable to watch television or a video at home. You can engage in homely talks with your loved ones while enjoying the program.

Given the choice of watching TV at home, it is definitely a wonderful time to spend.

What if the one watching a film in a cinema right next to you or behind you is constantly talking or even kicking the back of your seat? It's just too much of a nuisance to see a movie in this way. Moreover, recently cinemas become less and less accommodating, and tickets more and more costly.

","The Benefits of Reading Books 　　

I think the greatest benefit of reading books is to acquire knowledge. Books are the best friends of people that will accompany us as long as we live. Most of the knowledge we have acquired is through reading books. I myself benefit a great deal from reading. 　　

Reading helps us build the most important knowledge base. It is mainly through reading that one comes to understand the world. For instance, by reading American literature, the Chinese students learn that the descendants of the Mayflower are actually the puritans who emphasize both pragmatic well-being and personal cultivation. Reading also serves as one form of entertainment. Besides, reading helps one gain a better knowledge of human emotions like jealousy, hostility, anger, love, tolerance, compassion, or respect, etc. Reading offers us diversity and variety to our life experience when we are traveling across the boundaries between nations and cultures with the author as the guide. An individual's experience is bound to be limited, but reading makes up for that limitation.

","Colleges Have Opened Their Doors Wider

Colleges have opened their doors wider in recent years because the student population has increased enormously from four million to more than seven million in less than six years since 1998. I am in favor of the expansion policy.

In my opinion, the enrollment increase will benefit individuals and the society alike on the ground that it allows more students to pursue their higher education. If it is a financial burden for some relatively poor families to send their children to college, they can apply for state loans and grants-in-aid to help their children to complete their college education. This may guarantee educational equality to a greater extent. Some show concerns over so rapid an expansion. They are afraid that some problems may arise from it, for example, employment after graduation. A lot more graduates may have difficulties finding a job, which will give rise to a social problem. Admittedly, a rapid increase of graduates places a heavy burden on the society. However, on second thoughts, we find that thanks to the expansion move, the overall competence of the workforce has been upgraded considerably. Moreover, college expansion program has created many new job opportunities.

I am convinced that the expansion policy is conducive to the development of education and the well-being of the society in general.

","Facing Frustration

As far as I am concerned, frustration is beneficial to people. Very often it is part of the price one needs to pay for their eventual success. It also stimulates people to overcome hardships and difficulties they are confronted with.

Success does not come from nowhere; instead it dictates hardships and difficulties in the course of pursuit. Though constant frustration may cause serious mental and health problems, which poses a big threat to the people, frustration appears to be a loyal companion on the way to success. Frustration is part of our life experience. In our process of growing up, we may inevitably experience it when confronted with situations that don't come up to our expectations. It is a test of our courage and flexibility when it befalls on us. If we are dominated by it, we may subject ourselves to serious psychological problems. To overcome it demands a strong will and great courage. If we harness frustration and take it as our source of knowledge and motivation, we may enjoy the ultimate joy of success. If you read those success stories carefully, you will understand that no heroes became successful without experiencing frustration.

So frustration is a matter-of-the-fact occurrence in life or career development. As long as you learn how to address it, there is no need to worry about it.

Fast food is my favorite. Many people like fast food, and it is especially true among children and teenagers. It's certainly difficult to think of any other food that represents the fast pace of modern life. 　　

Several reasons account for its popularity. First, it is very convenient and saves a lot of time. The trends of modern society tend to be seeking for efficiency, and fast food well serves this purpose. You just go into a fast food restaurant, order your food, and your food is ready in no time. You can either eat it there or take it home. Second, the clean and comfortable environment of fast food restaurants, the excellent service, and the guaranteed quality of food are what most customers want. In terms of nutrition, however, fast food is far from satisfactory. It usually does not compose a balanced diet and is high in fat and cholesterol. But cooking at home is time-consuming and washing-up the dishes is frustrating. The fast pace of modern life does not allow every one enough time to cook at home.

Taking the above mentioned into consideration, I do think that fast food is a good choice at least for the time being.

The technological advances of the last few years have been amazing. Never before have students had such a wide variety of resources to help them with their studies. Those who can take advantage of these resources have the opportunity to learn about more subjects and to acquire more in-depth knowledge. In my opinion, students can indeed learn more quickly with the help of modern technology.

The piece of technology most important as a learning tool must be the computer. Paired with the Internet, it allows students to research topics more quickly and thoroughly and to write up their findings more rapidly as well. Furthermore, advances in many fields are being made so fast these days that it is impossible for textbooks to keep up. Technology allows students to keep abreast of the latest development. Also, it cannot be denied that many students enjoy using such resources in their studies. Because of this, they are more likely to pursue subjects in greater depth.

For all these reasons, I believe that technology can bring about great benefit to today's students. Of course, it is still possible to learn without the aid of such devices, but I believe that those students who are fortunate enough to have access to technological resources should take every advantage of them.

If college students can't even do the most basic things in their life, how can they handle big challenges under pressure in the future? In addition, college students should feel ashamed of disposing of their parents' hard-earned money in this way. Since a large proportion of their living expenses and tuition are covered by their parents, hiring cleaners could be considered a waste of money. Finally, I do not agree with those who claim they hire cleaners for the sake of either study or saving time. This is a mere excuse for their sloth and overreliance.

In summary, hiring cleaners should be discouraged on campus, where students are supposed to cultivate a sense of responsibility and independence rather than become lazy parasites.

"@@Should the Old People Live with Their Adult Children?@@

Nowadays it becomes a hotly debated issue whether old people should live with their adult children or not. What do you think of this issue?
","Should the Old People Live with Their Adult Children?

Nowadays, it is a heatedly discussed topic to many families that whether or not the old people should live with their adult children. If all the factors are contemplated, I think it is better for them not to.

Firstly, it may interfere with adult children's independence and freedom. The situation will be worse if the adult children are already married. The new member of the family has no blood relations with the parents. When the relationship between the in-laws and the parents is not harmonious, the sons or daughters of the parents will be in an embarrassing situation. Secondly, people of different ages have different ways of life. The old people like a quiet, peaceful and regular life; whereas the young love noises, activities, and unrestrained enjoyment. Furthermore, people of different generations have different views and values. When the old live together with their adult children, they may disagree on matters ranging from minor domestic matters to national or international issues.

In short, it would be a better picture if the parents and their adult children do not live together: both the old and the young can enjoy complete independence and freedom,lead a life they like and keep intact their affections for each other.

","HUMAN CLONING OR NOT?

With the development of cloning technology, the debate over human cloning has been intensified. Proponents of human cloning believe that this technology will benefit the couples who cannot have children. However, I insist that human cloning should be banned for the following reasons.

First of all, biological problems underlying cloning are so complex that human cloning is unsafe. It is well known that animal cloning has a high rate of failure. Many animals are born dead or deformed. Even if some survive, they may have defects from which they die later. It was reported that the cloned mice that appeared normal showed evidence of genetic mutation. This is because the regulatory mechanisms, which occur normally during development, are disturbed during the process of cloning. In fact, we do not have enough knowledge about cloning and the technology at this stage. If we continue to clone humans, we may produce many abnormal people, which will be nothing but a disaster to our human kind.

Moreover, human cloning will bring some social and moral problems. For example, those who are unable to have children might choose to have a copy of one of them (e.g. a copy of husband). However, how should the wife react to a physical copy of her husband she is in love with? In addition, when the copy meets friends or relatives of the original, these people would be confused about the original and the copy. How they should treat the copy would be another problem. Besides identity, his social status would be a great headache to the society.

In conclusion, human cloning should be prohibited in the world, because it is scientifically unsafe and will trigger some social and moral crisis. Any attempt to clone humans is an irresponsible action to human life and should be severely punished.

"@@Are Dialects Just as Acceptable in Public Places?@@

Mandarin, or Putonghua, is the standard service sector language in our country. But recently, employees at a big city's subway station have been busy learning dialects of other parts of the country. Proponents say that using dialects in the subway is a way to provide better service. But opponents think that encouraging the use of dialects in public counters the national policy to promote Putonghua. What is your opinion?
","Are Dialects Just as Acceptable in Public Places?

China's State Administration of Radio Film and Television (SARFT) recently issued a notice banning domestic radio and TV stations from translating foreign radio and TV programmes into any local dialect. The notice said that such dialect translation contradicts the national initiative to promote Putonghua, or Mandarin, around the country. Foreign programmes that have been translated into dialects must be removed from television and radio immediately. The notice evoked a mixed response from experts and audio and video producers, as well as the general public. Many voiced their concerns that local dialects would be forbidden in public places. Mandarin, which means ""common language"", is the country's predominant language and is widely used by more than 70 percent of the population. However, local dialects still enjoy popularity for relatively less-educated people in some occasions. The dialects do make unique role and should be tolerated for existence in public places.

Though promoted widely in public places, dialects are acceptable in public places. First, it is more than a mere tool for communication. It is, most importantly, the messenger of its respective culture. If the dialect was eliminated from daily use, the culture will be broken. Second, Mandarin can absorb the elite part of local dialect to enrich its vocabulary and usage. This is the perfection of Mandarin from thousands of years blend and contact. The dialects can also be popular in the public. Along with the famous short play by comic actors in NE China, the local dialect came into the spotlight, and enjoyed more popularity throughout China. Such a cultural phenomenon represents the audience an attitude to local dialects which cater to the taste of the majority. Third, dialect is the only mean of communication to some undereducated local people. If local dialects are forbidden in the public places, they can not communicate.

To sum up, local dialects should be tolerated in public places for its unique role which Mandarin can not substitute. We should guarantee its survival because dialects stand for our spiritual land. From a long-term perspective, dialects should not and would not be wiped out. There is no need for any purposeful and deliberate attempt to protect dialects. Just let dialects take their natural course. The best way to protect a dialect is to use it in daily life and pass it down from generation to generation.

"@@Should College Students Be Allowed to Change Their Majors Midway?@@

For a long time, universities in China adopt a rigid policy on students' selected major. Students can apply for several majors at a number of colleges or universities before they are enrolled into the university. Once this process has been completed, it is very difficult for students to alter their choices. Now many universities start to reduce restraint on major shift.
","Should College Students Be Allowed to Change Their Majors Midway?

Most Chinese college students know how difficult it can be to change their majors midway through their studies. Now, some universities have adopted a more flexible policy which allows students to change their majors without restraint, providing they can meet the entrance requirements of the course they wish to take. This has aroused a heated discussion. In my opinion, this alternation in major policy is good for students' development and should be practiced in all universities.

First, reducing the limitations previously imposed on changing majors gives students another chance to select their careers with a more mature outlook. It is well known that the majors many college students take are not what they are really interested in. As a result, some students have no zest in their major at all. In the past, students had to either struggle with their original choices or kill their time in desperation and wait for the second choice in their postgraduate studies. Therefore, restriction on changing major is in fact an artificial barrier for students' development and should be lifted.

Moreover, allowing students to shift to the major they are good at means better exploitation of their potential talent. Every student has his/her own passion and talent. Universities, as an important education institute, should try their best to help students to achieve their potential instead of suppressing it. There are numerous outstanding figures in history who gave up their original major and achieved great success in the new major. For example, Zhenning Yang would not have won the Nobel Prize if he had stuck to experimental physics.

In conclusion, we should provide students an opportunity to take a more decisive role in choosing their individual destiny. A flexible major policy can produce a win-win situation.

"Believing in the miracles of multimedia and Internet technology, some predict that the profession of teaching will disappear in the near future. But others claim that teachers will never be replaced. What is your view? You should supply an appropriate title for your essay.
","Teachers Cannot Be Replaced

Education is actually targeted at human beings for the sake of diverse intelligence and experiences. And this fact predetermines the existence of teaching as an indispensable profession in the course of education, although modern technology such as Internet and multimedia have significantly simplified and facilitated teaching. So I myself believe that teachers can never be replaced.

In the first place, teachers can adopt different strategies in accordance with students' specific developmental traits. Everyone is unique in terms of his or her endowed gifts, interests and personality. Thus a flexible and individualized way of imparting knowledge or skill is called for in the process of education, which is beyond the intelligence of computers and other modern technology. Take a problem in mathematics for example, some students may understand it after teachers' demonstration for the first time; but for those who have no knowledge base or appear relatively slow in mathematic intelligence, the teacher had better try to detect students' problem and work out another way to drive it home to them. And technically speaking, it is very hard to achieve the same result for a pre-designed educational software! As we all know, it requires extremely sophisticated technology to design a robot able to imitate human beings' simple behaviors, let alone personalized instruction on the part of teachers.

And furthermore, teachers not only confer knowledge on students, but also make significant contributions to shaping children's personalities. Along with academic study, students are taught how to tell the right from the wrong, how to share and cooperate with others, how to cope with difficulties and unpleasant experiences. Quite some celebrities often recall moral education in their early childhood and attribute their success to their teachers. Sometimes a seemingly trivial event or a portion of the teacher's comments may take a far-reaching effect in the rest of the child's life. How can some artificial intelligence compete against human wisdom and kindness in this respect? Like seedlings, all the appreciated virtues such as integrity, volition and teamwork need to be fostered by the ""gardeners"" purposefully. Just as the ancient Chinese saying goes, it takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to educate a person.

Thus both academically and morally, teachers play a vital role in education and could never be possibly replaced by modern technologies. Like a torch, teachers light up the way of human's development and help students to know the world as well as themselves better. Were there no teachers, our life would be completely different from what it is now.

"@@Sending Teenagers to Study Abroad: Good or Bad?@@

Nowadays more and more parents send their teenage children to study abroad. This has drawn public attention. Some people believe it is good for the children while others are worried about the development of these teenagers.
","Sending Teenagers to Study Abroad: Good or Bad?

Over the past few years, more and more parents have been sending their children abroad, believing their experience of studying abroad will pave the way for their future success. Up to now, this rush is still on and has become widespread. This phenomenon has drawn public attention, with people standing on both sides. It is my contention that sending teenagers abroad without proper preparation may do more harm than good to their development.

First of all, these teenagers may have difficulty adapting to the new environment which might be totally different from the homeland they are used to, therefore they will probably experience the so-called culture shock. They may dislike the food, be unable to follow the teachers' teaching method, or have problems dealing with people around them. As a result, they may find nothing goes well at the beginning and thus feel lonely and frustrated. If these teenagers are not well prepared psychologically, probably their character will be severely afflicted.

Moreover, for these youngsters language can be a great barrier, which may cause difficulty in both their daily life and studies. As most of them have just graduated from middle schools when going abroad, their command of the foreign language is usually inadequate for living and studying in a foreign country. Consequently, they may find it hard to keep up with the teacher and feel at a loss as to how to use the library and how to hire an apartment. The pressure of study and stress of life may make them feel anxious and upset, which might in turn affect their academic development.

In conclusion, teenagers studying abroad will have an extremely difficult time, and their perspective of academic success is far from their parents' expectation. Therefore, sending teenagers abroad is an unwise decision. Parents should be careful when making such a choice.

"With English being compulsory to students in primary and secondary schools and colleges, English education has become an important part of China's educational system. The government has also added to the English fever by calling for citizens to learn English ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. However, some experts claim that people spend too much time and energy studying English, which subsequently become unnecessary in their daily life. Some other experts maintain that English is an internationally used language and studying it contributes to one's overall quality. What is your opinion?You should supply an appropriate title for your essay.
","We Do Need English

Given the context of economic globalization, we cannot deny the fact that English is highly meaningful in international cooperation and exchange, career development as well as personal development.

Firstly, English language is of crucial importance in international cooperation and exchange. Transnational cooperation in business, cultural exchanges, education and environmental protection and so on has become the norm of every single day. And throughout all the interactions, English, as a global language, is playing an indispensable role. English is spoken as an official language in more than 80 countries and it also functions as working language in the UN. Two thirds of the world trade is conducted in English. Since China's accession into WTO, China has inevitably become a member of the global village. To perform our duties and enjoy our interests as a significant member of the international community, we do need English by all means. Actually the remarkable economic development in China in the past two decades is to a great extent attributed to the efforts of competent individuals who possess adequate knowledge of foreign languages, English in particular.

Secondly, English is needed in our career development. The fact that English score is a must in many a qualification test proves that various institutions have paid close attention to their employees' English proficiency. This move is easily understandable because workers proficient in English are needed in international exchanges and English cannot be acquired overnight. In many developed countries, students are even required to take up two or three foreign languages, the reason being that they are well aware that such a competence may become handy some day. As a developing country, China has a great deal to learn from other countries. In order to achieve that objective, we definitely need English as a facilitative tool.

Thirdly, English is significant in regard to one's personal development. English is compulsory in elementary, secondary and tertiary education. More often than that, one will have to pass English proficiency tests to climb the educational ladder. Even when you throw yourself to self-study, English will invariably usher you into a wonderland of enchanting literacy. Some people complain that we have invested too much time and energy on English. It may be true, but obviously it is not English that is to blame. Perhaps we should reexamine our learning and teaching strategies in an attempt to boost English learning and teaching efficiency.

To sum up, with the rapid advancement of economic and cultural globalization, English has become more and more desirable in international affairs, career and personal development. There is no point in denying the significance of English in our country.

","Contract Makes No Difference

In the wake of an increasing number of cheating cases and the emergence of cheating by advanced technology, a new invention—academic honesty contract between students and the institution has been introduced in numerous campuses before examinations. It is assumed that such contracts may help discourage cheating. As far as I see it, those contracts make no difference regarding the examinees' honesty.

In the first place, the issue of young students' honesty calls for the concern of the whole society. Living in the present community, the examinees are influenced by what is valued in it in one way or another. The increasingly rampant cheating in examinations reveals the tragic fact that honesty no longer prevails in the society. It is relatively easy to make students sign honesty contracts, but can we ask government officials and businessmen to do the same? Even if we were able to do that, would there be no more corrupt officials and unscrupulous merchants? The answer is a resounding ""No"". Likewise, without effective regulations and supervisions, honesty contracts signed by students can do little in deterring cheating, let alone address the root cause of the problem.

Secondly, honesty contract does not have any legal effect. Although the experience of signing such contract will be engraved in the examinees' memory, few students took it serious because the practice seems to have taken some characteristics of a political campaign and because it has little legal effect. In consequence, examinees feel little weight of the so-called promise or vow as we cannot deprive their right to take examinations if students refuse to sign the contract. If this is the case, how can we expect this move to work wonders?

Thirdly, honesty contract is likely to offend the students' self-esteem. Such contracts are based on the presumption that most examinees are potential cheaters, therefore students are inclined to believe that they are not trusted and respected. When one is treated like that, would they be willing to do what they are expected? Probably it is just the opposite. With the help of modern technology, some students may conjure up imaginative ways to beat such policy. So the contract is more of a formality and it would not do much to eradicate cheating.

Honesty is the best policy, yet honesty is not an inborn moral quality. To stamp out misconduct in examinations, we should adopt a comprehensive approach. Honesty contract would not produce substantial results as expected.

"Nowadays the number of visitors to university campuses begins to rise sharply, especially the more notable institutions likePeking University and Tsinghua University. From a student's perspective, do you think universities should open to the public? Write an essay of about 400 words to state your view. You should supply an appropriate title for your essay.
","Universities Should Open to the Public

Nowadays university campus sees more and more visitors, many of whom are parents and prospective students searching for a sense of the atmosphere of the school and others are tourists who regard prestigious institutions likePeking University and Tsinghua University as scenic spots during Labor Day and National Day holidays. But the issue has drawn public attention and triggered heated debate over whether it will upset campus safety or distract students from studying. In my opinion, universities should open to the public.

First of all, opening the university would not only draw visitors from other crowded scenic spots, but also can satisfy people's respect and interest in education and culture. Undoubtedly it is advisable when people choose to visit universities rather than casinos. In the United States, all universities are open to the public, even after ""9.11"" terrorist attack, be it Harvard or Yale. The goal is not to make revenue from tourists, but to pique curiosity and interest in institutions of higher learning. China has invested profusely in the development of universities, especially in the past two decades. And Chinese parents all dream of sending their children to universities, especially the highly regarded ones. Although no material return is available to invite visitors to campus, the long-term and intangible benefits of this practice are far-reaching.

Secondly, these universities are state-owned and should serve public interests. A large quantity of the money that the government has invested in the school comes from taxpayers. Even funds raised by the university itself are from those who take it as public resources. University visitors consist of parents and their children from all walks of life, so they are entitled to have access to public resources. These parents only hope that their children can experience the school's cultural atmosphere and encourage them to aim high for their future. Besides, it is also helpful for the university to build its good image, publicize itself, and reach out to common people.

Thirdly, there is nothing universities are inclined to hide from the public. What really bothers when visitors tour the campus, the library, the gym or even sit in lectures provided that no interruption is caused. The number of visitors actually signals how the public trusts and respects the university.

In a word, the spirit of openness is called on in the issue, while common visitors should cherish this golden opportunity and help to maintain a good order on campus. Only by mutual respect and efforts, can this practice develop into a win-win situation.

"Traffic congestions are a headache in many cities across the country as a result of rapid increase of private cars. Therefore, some people suggest that a limit be put on the number of private cars. Do you agree or disagree with such a proposal? Write anessay of about 400 wordsto state your view. You should supply an appropriate title for your essay.
","A Limit Should Be in Place on Private Cars

With the spur both of the advancement of automobile industry and China's accessory to WTO, the number of private cars is rocketing in the country. Some people still cling to the idea that a private car signifies wealth and freedom. Personally, I strongly contend that a limit should be in place on private cars.

In the first place, too many private cars give rise to traffic jams, thus slowing down the traffic speed and consequently economic development. Today drivers and pedestrians alike complain the traffic is becoming more and more crowded, often resulting in more of a nightmare of the street. Private cars are much to blame for traffic congestions given their lion's share in the total of vehicles in the street. If no effective measures are taken, the comfort and freedom associated with driving a private car are most likely to be drowned in frustration and waste of time and energy. The situation would be worsened when a driver arrives at work later than a cyclistwho travelsthe same distance.

In the second place, although automobiles have been playing a vital part in the daily functioning of our society, they do create us numerous troubles such as more serious environmental pollution, more traffic accidents and more energy consumption. Ten years later, car pollution in many Chinese cities will be out of control if the number of private cars is not limited right away. As more and more cars are produced and put in the street, our right to breathe clean air is infringed because the quality of air is endangered. Where the right of non-drivers cannot be guaranteed, the right of choice on the part of drivers should stop. The increasing number of car accidents which have killed and is going to kill absolutely innocent people set us rethinking about the real point of driving a car.

Last but not the least, it is not inexpensive to drive a car, as the prices of gasoline and repairs are constantly on the rise, not to mention the cost for yearly tax and insurance coverage. Hence people should think over the strengths and weaknesses before jumping at a quick decision to buy a car. Are you still tempted to buy a car when you realize that the vehicle is likely to kill, pollute and nibbles away your hard-earn green backs on a daily basis?

Given the traffic headaches, environmental and safety hazard as well as increasing costs, it is high time we should restrict the number of private cars. We should resort to environment-friendly transportation and ways of living.

Such practice has been strongly criticized by certain news agencies and some citizens. What's your view? You should supply an appropriate title for your essay.
","Professors Should Not Be Paid for Media Interviews

Professors are usually experts in a domain, therefore their insights and comments more often than not add truths, objectivity as well as profoundness to interview programs. Understandably it takes time and energy to prepare for the media interview on the part of professors, but it does not justify paid interviews.

Firstly, professors themselves benefit from the interviews. Being interviewed is an interactive process instead of a one-way information flow. While contributing to the programs, they can hopefully win wider recognition from the society in regard to their research and in turn gain more academic prestige. When being interviewed, they can also sharpen their minds by communicating with others. As they are put in the limelight, they make themselves better known to the public so that their social profile is likely to be raised. In this sense, it is professors who might be charged because they are not doing something for nothing.

Secondly, paying professors for interviews may upset the authenticity and objectivity of the program. Paid professors may deliberately cater to media' tastes when offering their points of view or they are inclined to voice ideas they themselves do not believe in because of the payment. If media are manipulated somewhat like this by money, press freedom is obviously at stake and the audiences, the ultimate patrons for media, are fooled. Definitely that is not what media are expected of. In China, media are state-owned, therefore they ought to function for the interests of the general public rather than the small portion of citizens.

Thirdly, paid interviews may pose threat to moral standards of the society, especially on campus. Professors are not only expected to impart knowledge to students, they should also set shining examples for their students in ethics and morality. Demanding payment for interviews may be looked upon as a deplorable sign that institutions of higher learning are falling prey to corruption. And young students are likely to follow suit, asserting that everything can be purchased. At any rate, professors should practice what they preach instead of leading their students astray.

All in all, paid interviews may give rise to the illusion that everything can become merchandise under market economy. Such an idea is detrimental because it brings harms to objective and independent reporting and harbors corruption in the long run. Actually media interviews are win-win occasions to the news agency and professors alike.

"@@Should Grant-aided Students Own Mobile Phones?@@

With the rapid development of communications technology, mobile phones have become daily necessities for many a university student these days. But one provision has come into effect in some institutions that grant-aided students should not own cell phones as they are regarded as a luxury item and aided students should live a simple life.
","Should Grant-aided Students Own Mobile Phones?

For various reasons students in need sometimes become the focus of attention on the media. But I could by no means tell just why grant-aided students are not allowed to have their access to mobile phones. To me such a provision is groundless and appears to be discriminative against students in need.

First, it is illegitimate to set additional conditions for aided students regarding how they should spend the financial support. Providing aid to students from impoverished families is the obligation for the government, not a kind of power. The power ought to function when deciding who are eligible for the subsidy rather than interfering in aid recipients' freedom to use the money. Aided students have a right to enjoy the grant and spend it in their own meaningful way. It impinges their privacy if any organization or individual wants to have a say then. To help those in need is a virtue, but a virtue should never stand side by side with bias and discrimination. If a university intends to further guide its students, it better resorts to moral education.

Second, why should there be a ban for cell phones if they are of convenience for those students' life and academic growth? In today's information era, being accessible is of great significance for students to communicate effectively with others. For instance, through mobile phones they can exchange useful information with each other, ask questions concerning lectures or seminars, reach professors or tutors for consultation and help themselves and others in an emergency. So what is improper for poverty-stricken students to access them to those benefits of a modern and prejudice-free technology? There is nothing wrong for poor students to hope for and enjoy a better life.

Third, the competitive market makes it possible for poor students to afford a cell phone. It is true that a cell phone was a luxury article a decade ago. Yet the world is advancing, which means that today the breadline is different from that of years before, that living standard for a grant-aided student is improving and that cheap and affordable handsets are available for students in need.

In conclusion, it is sensible to remind aided students to keep in mind that they should be grateful for the grant and not misuse the charity from others. However, to deny them of a practical modern invention like cell phone is going too far and likely to create discrimination against students in need.

"A recent survey conducted by China Youth Daily showed that 56 percent respondents believed that reputation of today's teachers has taken a big knock compared with two decades ago. What affects the reputation of this noble profession? You should supply an appropriate title for your essay.
","What Is Wrong with Teachers' Reputation?

China enjoys an age-honored tradition of respecting teachers, and a teacher is expected to play a role of not only as a mentor but a moral guide for students. However, as the survey indicates, this once noble profession is going through a bad patch. As far as I see it, a number of reasons contribute to the phenomenal change.

First, teachers are actually scapegoats of the public's dissatisfaction with the negative effects as a result of China's educational reform. One well-preserved Chinese tradition is to save money in banks, and one important purpose for doing that is for the cost of children's education. It is often reported that students from poverty-stricken regions or poor families give up their hard-earned opportunity to pursue higher education or drop out of school for the only reason that they can not afford it. In the meanwhile, economic development makes it possible for teachers to be better paid than before. When the two phenomena are viewed together, teachers become the outlet for the public indignation because education system is too abstract to blame.

Second, some teachers' over-enthusiasm for material well-being deteriorates teachers' image. Given a worldwide scenario, teaching is not a profession that makes a fortune compared with occupations like lawyers or doctors. Yet the fact is that a considerable number of teachers today are in favor of the irrational and extravagant educational charges. Besides, quite some of them moonlight in their spare time or organize private classes in order to turn a quick profit. Frequently they are taking advantage of students and their parents and creating educational inequity before they realize it. No one expects teachers to be as poor as a church mouse, nor does anyone wants teachers to become money-oriented while forgetting what their responsibility really is.

Third, the public is dissatisfied with the degradation of teachers' professionalism. With the largest population in the world, China needs the largest team of teachers to sustain her education. But current social status and income level for teachers fail to attract enough qualified individuals to enter this trade. Consequently many a teacher is wanting in schooling, competence, sense of responsibility, let alone dedication to the widely-revered career. Unfortunately the public's, especially the parents' expectation for teachers keeps growing. Thus the degradation of teachers' reputation becomes an inevitable trend.

In short, the public's dissatisfaction with education reform, teachers' over enthusiasm about money and lack of professionalism all result in the knock of teachers' reputation.

","Early Childhood Education

It is a tradition in China that parents have a high expectation of their children. As education is considered as the most important way to success, young couples today pay more and more attention to their children’s early education. Many parents send their children to classes of English, drawing, music, dancing and so on. On the other hand, many people are strongly against this phenomenon. In my opinion, early childhood education can be beneficial to children’s future, but it should be conducted properly.

First of all, good early education can be a lifetime benefit to children. As we know, children are generally quick to learn new knowledge and master a new skill. So childhood is usually believed to be the golden time to learn. Many people share the experience that what they have learnt in their childhood often helps lay a solid foundation for their future success. Many well-known musicians, sports stars, and scientists owe their success to early childhood learning experiences.

However, early childhood education should not be conducted by force. Many young couples, with high expectation of their children, often force their children to learn when the children are reluctant to or fail to meet their requirement. This often results in children’s loss of interest in learning and confidence in themselves. Therefore, if parents really think it is important or necessary for their children to learn some knowledge or a certain skill, they should first try to arouse their interest in it. When the children do have the desire and the potential, parents can provide them with good conditions, which will not be too late.

In conclusion, early childhood education is important for children’s development. It, however, should not be carried out only according to parents’ will. Children’s interest should also be taken into consideration.

","In Support Of Disabled Students’ Access To Higher Education

For a long time in China, disabled people are left at the side-lines when it comes to higher education. Since the introduction of the anti-discrimination law in 1991, there has been a heated dispute on disabled students’ access to higher education. In my point of view, disabled students should have access to higher education.

First, it is immoral and cruel to deprive disabled students of the right for higher education. It is a great misfortune for disabled students to lose certain physical function(s). Deprivation of their right for higher education would undoubtedly worsen their situation and make their future life even harder since education is one of the most important means to achieve a happy life. Some of them, having overcome countless great difficulties caused by their physical problems, manage to achieve good academic results. It is definitely inhuman to neglect the great efforts they make for success and smash their hope for a good life. Besides, higher education can enable disabled students to become useful citizens to the society rather than a burden on the society. Disabled people can also be intelligent, many of whom have made remarkable contribution to the world. Some of the well-known examples include Franklin Roosevelt, Helen Keller etc. Going over their life experiences, we can easily draw a conclusion that they owed their great success to the good education they received. Therefore, discrimination against disabled people may lead to a great loss of many talents.

In conclusion, we have the obligation to help these people in misfortune to live a happy life, instead of pushing them to an even worse situation. As disabled students with good schooling can contribute to the development of our country, shutting the door of higher education to them is not only unethical but also unwise.

"@@Will Teachers be Replaced by Computers in the Future?@@

With the development of society, the computer has pervaded almost all areas of life. Some work which used to be done by human beings can be completed by computers. Therefore, some people assume that teachers will be replaced by computers in the future. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
","Will Teachers be Replaced by Computers in the Future?

In education, the computer is playing an increasingly important role, so some people assume that teachers will be replaced by computers one day. However, I believe that computers will never be able to replace teachers.

Firstly, the computer can never fulfill teachers' role in nourishing the human mind and spirit. Education is more a process of instructing students emotionally and psychologically than passing on knowledge mechanically. It is widely acknowledged that successful education is always based on a large amount of investment of love and concern. Students need teacher's love while in difficulty, for teachers' encouragement can help them gain confidence. No wonder the famous blind educator and writer Helen Keller once said, ""My teacher's love illuminates my dark life and enables me to find my direction."" But how could students get all of these from an inanimate machine even if all the information of the world could be stored in it?

Another demanding task computers cannot perform is that they cannot teach students according to their individual gifts. A competent teacher is always good at finding out students' shining points. For example, when Gauss was a child, his teacher realized he had a special talent in mathematics and helped him exploit his potential and thus set him to the way of tremendous success in mathematics. This work, of course, is beyond any computer's ability. Besides, teachers can adjust their teaching to different students of different characteristics. Students' characteristics are so diversified that computers can hardly be programmed to meet this requirement.

In conclusion, no matter how advanced computers will be in future, education still has to be fulfilled by teachers. The teacher is able to be fully aware of students' needs and offer them what they really want accordingly while the computer is merely a tool manipulated by human beings to assist the fulfillment of such tasks.

"@@Grandparents Raising Grandchildren@@

In China, the social and financial pressure on parents is on the rise, particularly on mothers. With many young parents too busy with their paid jobs, children are often left to their grandparents.
","Grandparents Raising Grandchildren

In China, many grandparents undertake the responsibility of raising their grandchildren when the young parents are too busy with their paid jobs. This phenomenon has been the subject for dispute for some time. In my opinion, young parents should take care of their children by themselves because there are many disadvantages in grandparents taking care of grandchildren.

First, children who are left to grandparents at an early age may be educationally disadvantaged later in life because they may miss important early learning opportunities that occur in parent-child interaction. It is widely acknowledged that childhood is the golden time to learn. As most young parents receive better education than the grandparents, they can better assist children in their early learning. Scientific investigation has also shown that intimate parent-child contact accelerates children's language acquisition and intellectual development.

Moreover, children brought up by grandparents can develop emotional defects. All children are most attached to their parents by nature. When unwillingly living apart from their parents and seeing other children enjoying parents' love and attention, these children may have a feeling of abandonment, which may develop into an incurable trauma in their later life.

Last, but not the least, children's psychological development can be severely affected. These children, deprived of direct care from their parents, are usually spoiled by their grandparents. Consequently, these children are more likely to develop such psychological problems as egoism and egotism.

In conclusion, grandparents raising grandchildren may cause negative effects on children's intellectual, emotional and psychological development. Therefore, the best place for children is always at their own parents' side.

"@@Early Childhood Education@@

Many parents believe that early childhood education is extremely important for children's development. How far do you agree or disagree with them?
","Early Childhood Education

It is a tradition in China that parents have a high expectation of their children. As education is considered as the most important way to success, young couples today pay more and more attention to their children's early education. Many parents send their children to classes of English, drawing, music, dancing and so on. Nevertheless, many people are strongly against this phenomenon. In my opinion, early childhood education can be beneficial to children's future, but it should be conducted properly.

First of all, good early education can be a lifetime benefit to children. As we know, children are generally quick to learn new knowledge and master a new skill. So childhood is usually believed to be the golden time to learn. Many people share the experience that what they have learnt in their childhood often helps lay a solid foundation for their future success. Many well-known musicians, sports stars, and scientists owe their success to early childhood learning experiences.

However, early childhood education should not be conducted by force. Many young couples, with high expectation of their children, often force their children to learn when the children are reluctant to or fail to meet their requirement. This often results in children's loss of interest in learning and confidence in themselves. Therefore, if parents really think it is important or necessary for their children to learn some knowledge or a certain skill, they should first try to arouse their interest in it. When the children do have the desire and the potential, parents can provide them with good conditions, which will not be too late.

In conclusion, early childhood education is important for children's development. It, however, should not be carried out only according to parents' will. Children's interest should also be taken into consideration.

"@@Human Cloning or Not?@@

Since the first cloned mammal Dolly was produced, the issue of human cloning has aroused heated debate all over the world.
","Human Cloning or Not?

With the development of cloning technology, the debate over human cloning has been intensified. Proponents of human cloning believe that this technology will benefit the couples who cannot have children. However, I insist that human cloning should be banned for the following reasons.

First of all, biological problems underlying cloning are so complex that human cloning is unsafe. It is well known that animal cloning has a high rate of failure. Many animals are born dead or deformed. Even if some survive, they may have defects from which they die later. It was reported that the cloned mice that appeared normal showed evidence of genetic mutation. This is because the regulatory mechanisms, which occur normally during development, are disturbed during the process of cloning. In fact, we do not have enough knowledge about cloning and the technology at this stage. If we continue to clone humans, we may produce many abnormal people, which will be nothing but a disaster to our human kind.

Moreover, human cloning will bring some social and moral problems. For example, those who are unable to have children might choose to have a copy of one of them (e.g. a copy of husband). However, how should the wife react to a physical copy of her husband she is in love with? In addition, when the copy meets friends or relatives of the original, these people would be confused about the original and the copy. How they should treat the copy would be another problem. Besides identity, his social status would be a great headache to the society.

In conclusion, human cloning should be prohibited in the world, because it is scientifically unsafe and will trigger some social and moral crisis. Any attempt to clone humans is an irresponsible action to human life and should be severely punished.

"@@Psychological Education in Schools@@

Some people suggest that schools, including primary schools, middle schools and colleges, should carry out psychological education. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
","Psychological Education in Schools

It is reported that nowadays the number of students with psychological problems in middle schools and universities is growing rapidly. Therefore, many people propose that schools should carry out psychological education. Personally, I entirely agree with this proposal.

First of all, students are the social group most likely to incur psychological problems. Currently, Chinese students are under growing pressure: society puts high demands on them; parents have great expectations of them; and they also set themselves exacting challenges. But the fierce competition of various exams forces them to spend almost all their time on study, which deprives them of the chance to know themselves, or to grasp and apply practical social skills.Moreover, most students are brought up in uneventful circumstances, so they are psychologically immature and fragile, and consequently lack adaptability. When encountered with frustration or adversity, they may retreat or react with excessive ""countermeasures.""

In the next place, students cannot get the psychological guidance they need. Currently, few Chinese educational institutions have established a psychological health system, and psychological education within primary and middle schools remains nil. In most cases, students are left to kill the time in their psychological class. Besides, there is not enough communication between parents, teachers and students. As a matter of fact, parents and teachers attach so much attention to young people's study that they often neglect their mental health. All these factors contribute to the increasing psychological problems in students.

In a word, psychological education is imperative for Chinese students. All schools should offer psychological education so as to achieve the ultimate goal of education—to foster students' capacity for survival, good inter-personal skills, and the means of advancing human civilization.

"@@Married Women's Choice: Housewives or Career Women@@

Today, a great number of people hold that a man should devote himself to building up a career while a woman's role should be at home. Some even propose that married working women should quit their jobs to be full-time housewives, but some strongly oppose it.
","Married Women's Choice: Housewives or Career Women

As many families become rich enough to spare wives from having to work, the centuries-old Chinese value revives that a woman's position is at home. The question of whether to be a housewife or a career woman puzzles many Chinese married women. In my opinion, women should never quit their career.

In the first place, when a woman leaves her job and becomes a full-time housewife, family and husband will be the center of all her life, and she will gradually lose her self-esteem and become spiritually dependent on her husband. However, if the husband is too busy to spare as much time for her as she has expected, she will feel empty and frustrated.

Moreover, great differences in the living environment between husband and wife may result in a tremendous gap, which may ruin the harmonious family relationship. When a woman gives up her paid job, she will be isolated from the society, and thus ignorant of the latest happenings in the world while her husband who fully participates in various social activities will be well-informed and upgraded concerning taste and knowledge. Consequently, the couple will have difficulties communicating with each other. This may lead to serious family crisis.

Last, but not the least, a married woman, when quitting the job, will lose economic independence, which is most important in case of divorce. As the divorce rate is growing higher and higher in today's society, women need to have a career so that they will have a means to support themselves and their children when marriage breaks up.

In conclusion, a career enables women to live a fuller and safer life. They should have their career for the well-being of themselves and their families.

"@@Isa College Degree Necessary in Today's World?@@

Some people suggest that schools, including primary schools, middle schools and colleges, should carry out psychological education. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?
","Isa College Degree Necessaryin Today's World?

Because a 4-year college education requires a large commitment of time, effort, and money, many high school graduates decide not to go to college. They enter the work force immediately, or decide to go to a vocational or trade school instead of college. Is a college degree really necessary these days? Despite the expense and delay in entering the work force, I strongly believe that a 4-year college education is necessary and desirable in today's world.

One major reason to go to college is that college provides necessary academic background for a career. During four or more years in college, students have time and resources to explore many different areas in humanities, social sciences, science, and professional fields such as business and engineering, and to take a variety of academic courses that will provide important background for particular careers.

A second important argument for the value of college is that people with college degrees have better job opportunities and higher income levels than people who have only a high school and/or vocational school education, so college means a better quality of life. Job opportunities and starting salaries are generally excellent for people with college degrees while the employment outlook may not be so cheerful for those with only a high school diploma.

Also, college tends to provide a labor force with a certain knowledge and skill, which is beneficial to the advancement of our society. Students who exercise their minds and develop strategies to deal with hard problems over four years of college are likely to graduate with many skills and strategies that can be transferred to dealing with tasks later in life, both on the job and in their personal life. This will surely contribute to the progress of the world.

In summary, there are many good arguments in support of the value of a 4-year college education. All in all, the benefits far outweigh the problems and expense. I firmly believe that everyone who wants to have a bright future should go to college.

"@@What I Have Learned from My Years at University@@

In a few months' time you are going to graduate from university. How do you think your college years have prepared you for your future life?
","What I Have Learned from My Years at University

More than two thousand years ago, Confucius, one of the greatest philosophers and educators in Chinese history, sigh with grief while standing on the river and compared the transient passage of time to the flowing water. With a blink of eyes, I will graduate from this university a few months later. At this moment, I think I have a deeper understanding of this great thinker's saying. Thinking of my impending graduation, I am excited but meanwhile I am upset, mixed with some other feelings beyond words. Looking back on the details of the past few years, I can't help asking myself, ""What have I learned from my years at university?""

I think in the passing years I have gained more knowledge and acquired some basic professional skills, which will lay a sound foundation for my future career.

Through the involvement in various social activities and participation in different clubs and association, I got to know more friends as well as my classmates. By getting along with them, I have acquired some useful communicative skills and begun to know how to understand and appreciate others, which I suppose, will be expected to play an important role in my future life. More importantly, I have gained the abilities to handle problems and deal with crises independently.

If it is safe to say that I have ever achieved some achievements at university, I'd like to attribute them to my teachers, classmates and friends. Without their staunch support and unselfish aid, I wouldn't have reached one goal after another. With them I have established an intimate relationship and I believe I will continue to benefit from it.

In the spare time, I often went to do some sports with my friends. I have been fond of playing table tennis and badminton. And I went to the gym once or twice a week with them. By going in for the sports, I became stronger and stronger and I am sure you will see everything when you see my robust constitution.

Before I went to college, I had been somewhat bashful and even blushed to speak in public. But now I can talk like a streak for a few hours. Isn't it amazing?

I believe that we study at university not only to learn professional skills and knowledge, that will be behind the times soon, but more importantly, we have to master the way of thinking and acquire some abilities that we learn beyond books. With these qualities I am sure that we will have enough confidence to meet with the challenges in the future.

","This graph compares hospitalization of males and females as a result of drug use and acute alcohol intoxication from 2005 to 2006. It is clearly seen that males and females both take drugs and generally women use more drugs throughout all age groups except young people aged between 26 and 36. The grey line indicates a gradual decline for females taking drugs from a young age of 15 till around 62. However, from 62 a slow rise makes its way in how much they take.

"Task 2 You should spend about 40 minutes on this task: Present a written argument to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic: Hollywood movies have the audiences from all over the world. And they have an impact on local movies. Some people think that Hollywood movies pose a threat to the local ones, while others hold the view that Hollywood movies are good for local films’ development. Discuss and give your view. You should write at least 250 words. Use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your argument with examples and relevant evidence.
","Hollywood movies can be seen almost in every corner of the earth, which makes it more like a global theatre instead of an American one. Its popularity can not be competed by any other national film industry. While Hollywood has contributed a lot to the world cinema culture, it is also considered as a threat to the local film industry. However, this essay argues that rather than threatening local films, Hollywood movies benefit local movies and boost the world cinema production as a whole. Facing the blame that Hollywood movies force local films into a dangerous position, one countering voice is that the embracing nature in the Hollywood movie production industry provides chances for talents from all over the world to work together and to learn from each other. Therefore, the film workers bring home what they have obtained through exchanging and learning process in Hollywood, to develop the local film industry later on. On the other hand, Hollywood movies are not necessarily a foe all the time. A good enemy makes a good teacher. The fierce competition from Hollywood stimulates the local film industry to self-improve in order to survive. For instance, cinemas in China, Japan, Italy, and France have all learnt a great deal from Hollywood, from advertising, producing to accessory industries. Hollywood is not killing the local cinema. Quite contrarily, it helps the local cinema, which is willing to learn, improve, and shine even more sparklingly. To conclude, in an internationalized era, it is impossible for local movies to live in a small community of their own. Hollywood can temporarily cause the local film industry setbacks. However, in the long run it will push local cinemas to a higher level. As a result, the world film industry as a whole will be promoted to a more prosperous situation. （302字）

What are the causes of and solutions to juvenile obesity. You should write at least 250 words. Use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your argument with examples and relevant evidence.
","Over-weight teenagers are now quite common in all places all over the world. The Health Summer Camps everywhere are usually full of chubby teens whose parents worry about their kids’ health, while on the other hand the youngsters are failed to be told to eat less and to exercise more. The indulgence from the parents to their children is a main cause of this problem. Compared with the last century, global economy has experienced great leap and many places in the world have witnessed rise of prosperity from poverty. Parents who suffered from starvation in their childhood now are wealthy enough to feed their kids with all kinds of treats. The last thing they want is to have their kids go through what they have been through. However, this kind of psychological compensation deprives the parents of rationality to deny their kids excessive food. As long as their kids ask for it, parents shrug “well, the more food, the better”. Apart from the indulging parents, educational system should also be blamed for the increasing number of teenage obesity. In schools, classes like Literature and Science are highly valued while lessons like art, health, and physical education are very much neglected. Take China as an example. Chinese students need good academic records in order to be enrolled in universities while records of physical education are not so importantly considered. Thus, teenagers are encouraged to spend more time sitting at their desks instead of exercising in the open. Cooperation between parents and teachers is required to tackle this problem. On one hand, parents should deny their kids excessive food such as fast-food, snacks and other treats. Then, fat and greasy food should be erased from teenagers’ menus. Moreover, a balanced and healthy diet need to be introduced to and promoted among teenagers and their parents. On the other hand, teachers should attach more attention to physical education at school. A successful education is to cultivate a mentally knowledgeable and equipped, and physically soundly built generation. In conclusion, the changing attitudes of both parents, teenagers themselves, and teachers are vital for reducing juvenile obesity. Rather than a trivial matter of body shape or food consumption, this issue, in fact, concerns with the healthier development of the younger generation, which will support future development of the society.

","The table shows the change in computer users in 17 countries worldwide from 2002 to 2005. In each of the 13 countries for which historical comparisons can be made, more people now use computers at home, school or work than in 2002. The raise is dramatic in Turkey, Russia, India and Poland, where the number of those who use a computer has risen from 13 to 16 percent in the three-year period from 2002 to 2005. Great Britain has seen the largest increase in computer use, up 17 percent since 2002. More modest gains have been made in the U.S. (up 2%) and the rest of Western Europe (Germany up 4% and France 1%), where majorities already reported using computers in 2002 although even in these countries the use of such technology has increased significantly. Among those nations surveyed in 2005, the Netherlands leads in computer usage with fully 84% who use a computer either at home or in the workplace.

"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Write about the following topic: Today violence is very prevalent in schools worldwide. It has brought about many adverse effects on the growth of children. Discuss the reasons for school violence and find out solutions to tackle this problem. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words.
","Today violence is very prevailed in schools worldwide. It impedes students’ school performance and the number of teenagers skipping school in fear of getting hurt climbed. It’s imperative that reasons for school violence be studied and a series of effective solutions be taken before it’s too late. Below are my analysis and proposals. First, children are exposed to violence in TV programs and video games. Today both parents in most families work and leave their children unattended after school. When their children come home from school, they generally sit down and watch television or play video games, which contain a lot of violence. To deal with this, government should impose strict censorship on TV programs, expunging any scenes with excessive violence. At the same time, more productive extracurricular activities should be designed on the part of schools to occupy the hours after school where many youths are unsupervised. Second, bullying is another reason for the violent incidents that occur in our schools. A child may be bullied repeatedly at school. Unable to withstand the mental torture and agony, the child may resort to violence as a final measure. To address this issue, an anti-bullying program should be added in school curriculum to inform the students what to do when they are bullied. At the same time teachers and school authority should take effective actions to punish the bullies. Third, it’s too easy for school children to get guns. In many school violence guns are used and caused deadly results. Sometimes worry about becoming a victim may cause some students to carry a gun or to become offenders themselves. The most important solution to this is to guarantee that schools are weapon free. In conclusion, there are many other reasons for school violence worldwide, for instance, family violence and racial tensions, etc and more solutions need to be sought. However, whatever solution it is, the most important is to make sure that it is implemented.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words.
","These days, we hear about all of the stress in the world, and about how people are falling apart because of it. We can’t help asking this question—is stress good or bad? Are these stressful things actually causing problems, or is it something else? In my judgment, stress is actually neither good nor bad. It is our perception of stress that causes problems. Think about the time in your life when you have challenges that seem overwhelming. When you are successful at meeting these challenges, you probably feel exhilarated. When unsuccessful, chances are you feel upset, and your body responds negatively. However, whether you are successful or unsuccessful at negotiating the challenges in your life, you can choose how you will react. In this way, you can avoid those negative physiological changes. An analogy may help you view stress in an easier way and deal with it better. Imagine that you are in a sailboat with only the wind to power you. The wind can be compared to stress. Not having any stress, or any challenges to overcome, is like being in a sailboat without having any wind. When you have wind (stress), you can go places. The more challenges you have, the better you get at navigating. Stress pushes you forward to be more than you were before. However, if you let stress get the best over you, your boat can blow over. All in all, we can see that stress itself is neither good nor bad. The most important thing is to learn how to handle stress.

","Keeping a diary is many people’s life-long habit which often starts in childhood. Children keep diaries because it’s a place to store their feelings and secret stories. But their secrets are not really safe because many parents would snoop around reading things that are written in their diary. Some people argue that it’s important because they have the right to know what’s going on in their children’s lives. While I think diary is children’s zone of privacy which parents have to respect. I agree it is parents’ responsibility to know what’s going on in their children’ lives, but I don’t think it justifies breaking trust and respect by reading their diaries. Reading a child’s diary is a terrible violate of privacy that will do much more harm than good to the parent-child relationship. The children would stop communicating with their parents and hide even important things from them because they won’t trust them anymore. Children need privacy, respect and boundaries. In my judgment, talking is a much better solution. Parents should spend some time talking to their children every day about what’s going on in their lives and what they are thinking in their minds. Make sure your children know they can talk to you about anything without the fear of judgment or punishment. Developing a good relationship and fostering a bond of trust go much farther than sneaking around behind your child's back. To sum up, parents should respect their children by offering a reasonable degree of autonomy and privacy. Only in this way will children be more likely to respect them and confide them their true feelings and turn to them for advice when they need help.

Also, restrictions on driving time could be enforced on urban vehicle drivers. By reducing the amount of driving time of each car, we would be able to cut the whole amount of emission. For example, during the Beijing Olympic Games, half cars were forbidden from the roads every other day. The air quality reached high standards in several consecutive weeks. Seeing the effectiveness of the measure, the city government decided to continue the restriction on motor vehicles after the Games. Still another way is to install filters on exhaust pipes.

Global warming has become more and more serious in recent years. Discuss the effects of and solutions to global warming.

You should write at least 250 words.

Use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your argument with examples and relevant evidence.
","Gore’s shocking documentary The Inconvenient Truth brought the world to alarm once again, which reminded us once more of the worsening situation of our ozone layer. All the carbon dioxide we continuously and brutally force into the air has caused global warming, whose effects are beginning to show. This essay discusses the results of global warming and tries to seek possible solutions to this problem.

Do not be surprised if scientists argue in the media that natural disasters will be a regular visitor to our planet during a long period of time. Erse which occurred only once decades ago now sweeps over the oceans every two to three years. The more often visits from Tsunami, typhoons and tornadoes are the nature’s way of telling us that we must stop heating the earth.

Don’t be shocked if TV programs say that with the rising sea level, many of the centers of human civilizations will be buried under the sea in a foreseeable future. Lands like Tokyo, Manhattan, and even Shanghai will drown into the ocean sooner than we think. Global warming has caused the ice melt all over the world, especially in the Antarctic regions. Evidence shows that in recent decades the sea level rises more quickly than in any other period of time in history. In consequence, our architectures and cultures could probably disappear and be covered by water.

To tackle with this problem, it needs global efforts rather than efforts of a single nation. Green gas travels freely without the obligation of staying in national borders. Thus, green gas emission is a global issue which requires the cooperation from every single member of our international community. Firstly, each country shall shoulder their due responsibility and adopt measures to control the carbon dioxide emission into the air. Moreover, related regulations and laws should also be passed to confine those practices which endanger the eco-environment. Last but not the least, as the single most powerful international organization, it is time for the United Nations to urge all member countries to cooperate and tackle this problem.

Dramatic climate changes and rising sea levels are not horror stories, but fearful effects of global warming. Global warming should be stopped at all costs for there is only one earth. It is an international matter which everyone on the surface of this earth should care a lot about. Only when those attempts are made and fulfilled, could the earth be sustainable for future generations. (407字)

","This graph compares hospitalization of males and females as a result of drug use and acute alcohol intoxication from 2005 to 2006.

It is clearly seen that males and females both take drugs and generally women use more drugs throughout all age groups except young people aged between 26 and 36. The grey line indicates a gradual decline for females taking drugs from a young age of 15 till around 62. However, from 62 a slow rise makes its way in how much they take. For males, as shown in the black line, teenage drug users take the smallest amount, around 200(c). Young drug users aged from 26 to 36, during which males’ intake of drugs surpasses those of females, take the amount from 450(c) to 300(c), with the age around 34 reaching the peak. With the age accumulating from around 34, drugs are less taken, with males aged 67 taking the smallest amount.

The two broken lines indicate a general decline of hospitalization caused by acute alcohol intoxication with the age increasing, males surpassing females in all age groups. Both in two genders it has witnessed the same amount of alcohol taken as the rate of 110 (c). It is worth mentioning that men’s peak rate for acute alcohol intoxication is when they are around 43 and women’s, around 47.

Present a written argument to an educated reader with no specialist knowledge of the following topic:

Hollywood movies have the audiences from all over the world. And they have an impact on local movies. Some people think that Hollywood movies pose a threat to the local ones, while others hold the view that Hollywood movies are good for local films’ development. Discuss and give your view.

You should write at least 250 words.

Use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your argument with examples and relevant evidence.
","Hollywood movies can be seen almost in every corner of the earth, which makes it more like a global theatre instead of an American one. Its popularity can not be competed by any other national film industry. While Hollywood has contributed a lot to the world cinema culture, it is also considered as a threat to the local film industry. However, this essay argues that rather than threatening local films, Hollywood movies benefit local movies and boost the world cinema production as a whole.

Facing the blame that Hollywood movies force local films into a dangerous position, one countering voice is that the embracing nature in the Hollywood movie production industry provides chances for talents from all over the world to work together and to learn from each other. Therefore, the film workers bring home what they have obtained through exchanging and learning process in Hollywood, to develop the local film industry later on.

On the other hand, Hollywood movies are not necessarily a foe all the time. A good enemy makes a good teacher. The fierce competition from Hollywood stimulates the local film industry to self-improve in order to survive. For instance, cinemas in China, Japan, Italy, and France have all learnt a great deal from Hollywood, from advertising, producing to accessory industries. Hollywood is not killing the local cinema. Quite contrarily, it helps the local cinema, which is willing to learn, improve, and shine even more sparklingly.

The graph below shows short-term flows of visitors to and from China to Australia from 1982 to 2002.
","This graph shows the number of short-term flows of visitors to and from China to Australia in two decades between 1982 and 2002.

Generally, from 1982 to 1998, travellers from and to China are basically the same amount, starting about 10,000, with fluctuatations in between. And between 1998 and 2002, though the number of both arrivals and departures soared abruptly, there was still a huge differece in ranges, with departures to China, from 80,000 to 200,000, and arrivals from China, with 80,000 to 140,000. Two periods saw visitors arriving from Australia to China more than tourists from China, during 1982-1988 and 1990-1998 respectively. On the other hand, the flow of visitors from China peaked at 1989, with a number of about 50,000 in the period from1989 to 1990.

In conclusion, this graph clearly indicates the general trend of increasing with some flows in terms of Australian visitors’ arrivals in China and Chinese residents’ departures to Australia in those twenty years.

Obesity in juveniles is a very serious problem now. What are the causes of and solutions to juvenile obesity.

You should write at least 250 words.

Use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your argument with examples and relevant evidence.
","Over-weight teenagers are now quite common in all places all over the world. The Health Summer Camps everywhere are usually full of chubby teens whose parents worry about their kids’ health, while on the other hand the youngsters are failed to be told to eat less and to exercise more.

The indulgence from the parents to their children is a main cause of this problem. Compared with the last century, global economy has experienced great leap and many places in the world have witnessed rise of prosperity from poverty. Parents who suffered from starvation in their childhood now are wealthy enough to feed their kids with all kinds of treats. The last thing they want is to have their kids go through what they have been through. However, this kind of psychological compensation deprives the parents of rationality to deny their kids excessive food. As long as their kids ask for it, parents shrug “well, the more food, the better”.

Apart from the indulging parents, educational system should also be blamed for the increasing number of teenage obesity. In schools, classes like Literature and Science are highly valued while lessons like art, health, and physical education are very much neglected. Take China as an example. Chinese students need good academic records in order to be enrolled in universities while records of physical education are not so importantly considered. Thus, teenagers are encouraged to spend more time sitting at their desks instead of exercising in the open.

Cooperation between parents and teachers is required to tackle this problem. On one hand, parents should deny their kids excessive food such as fast-food, snacks and other treats. Then, fat and greasy food should be erased from teenagers’ menus. Moreover, a balanced and healthy diet need to be introduced to and promoted among teenagers and their parents. On the other hand, teachers should attach more attention to physical education at school. A successful education is to cultivate a mentally knowledgeable and equipped, and physically soundly built generation.

In conclusion, the changing attitudes of both parents, teenagers themselves, and teachers are vital for reducing juvenile obesity. Rather than a trivial matter of body shape or food consumption, this issue, in fact, concerns with the healthier development of the younger generation, which will support future development of the society.

Fully 22% of those with family incomes of less than $20,000 a year say it’s “very important” for them to be wealthy. That's more than double the proportion of those who earn $100,000 or more a year.

Interestingly, fully 13% of those in the less-than $20,000 income category say become wealthy is “not important at all” to them, nearly double the proportion of those in the $100,000 or more category who hold this view.

Nearly six-in-ten (56%) Americans earning $100,000 or more say money is “somewhat important” to them, compared with 35% of those making $20,000 or less. When those results are combined with the proportion of people who says being rich is “very important” to them, nearly two-third of those in the $100,000 or more category (66%) value wealth, compared with 57% of those who earn less than $20,000 a year.

Some people spend more than they can afford and never save money. Others spend reasonably and save for rainy days.

Discuss these two spending habits. Which spending habit do you prefer? Explain why.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

You should write at least 250 words.
","Different people have different spending habits. Some people spend more than they can afford and never save money. Others spend wisely and save for rainy days. In my judgment, people who base their expenses according to their income and set aside some money for later use are wiser and financially safer than those who live beyond their means. Below are the reasons for my view.

Many people spend every penny they have and never save money. They buy things they cannot afford by using credit cards, instead of waiting until they have saved enough money for them. This is a dangerous thing because credit card debt balloons rapidly and once they lose their job, they may suddenly find themselves unable to pay the debt, as is the case in the 2008 financial crisis.

Compared with the gloomy picture described above, those people who match their spending with their income and save for rainy days will not be so badly affected by the financial crisis. That’s why as the 2008 financial crisis swept across the world, Americans begin to realize the problem of their spending habits and Chinese’ save for the rainy day spending habit is valued highly by more and more people worldwide.

To sum up, it is always a virtue that everybody, haves or have-nots, should spend wisely and save for the rainy days. Everybody should realize that nothing is permanent in this world. One day you may be a billionaire, while some other day you may become penniless. We never know. We should always have our feet on the ground and learn to do things in a moderate way.

Everyone feels stress during their lives, sometimes every day. What do you think of stress? Is it good or bad?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

Write at least 250 words.
","These days, we hear about all of the stress in the world, and about how people are falling apart because of it. We can’t help asking this question—is stress good or bad? Are these stressful things actually causing problems, or is it something else? In my judgment, stress is actually neither good nor bad. It is our perception of stress that causes problems.

Think about the time in your life when you have challenges that seem overwhelming. When you are successful at meeting these challenges, you probably feel exhilarated. When unsuccessful, chances are you feel upset, and your body responds negatively. However, whether you are successful or unsuccessful at negotiating the challenges in your life, you can choose how you will react. In this way, you can avoid those negative physiological changes.

An analogy may help you view stress in an easier way and deal with it better. Imagine that you are in a sailboat with only the wind to power you. The wind can be compared to stress. Not having any stress, or any challenges to overcome, is like being in a sailboat without having any wind. When you have wind (stress), you can go places. The more challenges you have, the better you get at navigating. Stress pushes you forward to be more than you were before. However, if you let stress get the best over you, your boat can blow over.

All in all, we can see that stress itself is neither good nor bad. The most important thing is to learn how to handle stress.

Which viewpoint do you agree with?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

","Keeping a diary is many people's life-long habit. Children keep diaries because it's a place to store their feelings and secret stories. But their secrets are not really safe because many parents would snoop around reading things that are written in their diary. Some people argue that it's important because they have the right to know what's going on in their children's lives. While I think diary is children's zone of privacy which parents have to respect.

I agree it is parents' responsibility to know what's going on in their children' lives, but I don't think it justifies breaking trust and respect by reading their diaries. Reading a child's diary is a privacy violation that will do much more harm than good to the parent-child relationship. The children would stop communicating with their parents and hide even important things from them because they won't trust them anymore. Children need privacy, respect and boundaries.

In my judgment, talking is a much better solution. Parents should spend some time talking to their children every day about what's going on in their lives and what they are thinking in their minds. Make sure your children know they can talk to you about anything without the fear of judgment or punishment. Developing a good relationship and fostering a bond of trust go much farther than sneaking around behind your child's back.

To sum up, parents should respect their children by offering a reasonable degree of autonomy and privacy. Only in this way will children be more likely to respect them andconfide their true feelings to them and turn to them for advice when they need help.

","The table and corresponding line chart describe the changing of Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) as related to Consumer Expectation Index (CEI) and Consumer Satisfaction Index (CSI), with details covering June to November of 2008, from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. The trends for all of the indexes are rather similar, peaking in July and falling steadily afterwards through November.

The whole pattern of all three of them can be divided into two phases, the rising one and the falling one.

From June to July, all the indexes climbed up, with CEI from 96.5% to 96.9%, CSI, 90.6% to 90.8%, and CCI, 94.1% to 94.5%.

However, they unanimously headed to a downward trend from August, though each to a different degree. CCI featured the mildest fluctuation, from 90.2% in August to 90% in September, 89.8% in October and finally, 89.2% in November. The overall gap between August and November is only a minor 0.4 percentage point. On the other hand, CEI showed a dramatic plunge from 96% in July to 90.8% 4 months later, by a noticeable 5.2%. In between of these two indexes was CCI, which decreased from 93.7% to 90.2% steadily across the six-month period.

What is worth mentioning is that in November, all three figures are the closest to each other, with 90.8% for CEI, 90.2% for CCI and 89.2% for CSI. This indicates that when consumers adjusted their expectation to a lower level, satisfaction and confidence closer to their expectation would occur. In other words, the more realistic their expectation is, the more satisfied and confident consumers may feel. (260 words)

Many famous novels have beenadapted into movies and TV series.However, the trend seems going backward with money-making movies converted into books.

What is your opinion towards the trend?

Give reasons for your answer and include the relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

Write at least 250 words.
","A recent Chinese movie, You are the one not only enjoys a box office hit, but is also well received with its paperback version of the same story. It has been common that classical literary works are adapted to films, but not the other way around. The reverse trend seems a fresh idea embraced by many, including myself.

A look at the current lifestyle of many city dwellers will tell you why. Take Beijing as an example of large metropolis. The typical life-style of an average wage-earner is to spend 4 hours on the way to and from work, daily, 5 days a week. That leaves very limited time for them to go to cinema, but tons of hours to kill on the road. As most of them take public transportation, reading a paperback makes a practical choice for a commuter. Obviously, when seeing a movie becomes a luxury, time-wise, reading the novel version on a bus is the second best solution.

What happens after that is some readers my become interested in the movie and plan to go to see it once they have time, say in holiday, or by renting a DVD. Obviously, this does not apply to all the readers. But still, some of them will be converted to the movie goers. In another word, the books serve as a promotion of the movies. Actually, the books and the movies end up promoting each other. As a result, the producers are happy with revenue generated from two channels rather than one. Generally speaking, the more channels there are, the more clients are covered, which, in turn, brings more profit.

The graph below shows the number of visitors in a supermarket and a shopping mall in London.

Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

Write at least 150 words.
","There are many variations in the number of visitors in the supermarket and the shopping mall, according to the graph. This essay will review the information provided and propose possible causes for these variations.

As can be seen from the line graph, there was a steady increase in the number of visitors in the supermarket from 8 am to around 150 at 11 am. Then from 11 am to 2 pm, the number slightly declined. After that, the number rose and reached a peak of about 200 at 7 pm. From this point onwards, the number declined fast to almost zero at 11 pm.

According to the line graph, unlike the shoppers in the supermarket, the number of the shopping mall visitors slightly increased in the morning, topping about 80 at 1 pm. Then the number remained stable till around 7 pm when the number surged to almost 140. From 7 pm, the number plummeted to almost zero at 11 pm.

Therefore, it can be clearly seen from the line graph that the shoppers in the supermarket far outnumber those in the shopping mall. And more people tend to visit shopping places in the afternoon than in the morning.

","Pre-school training courses recently gained increased popularity among parents who want their kids grow up to be bright, smart and intelligent. ""Revolutionary, innovative and enlightening"" is a commonly seen slogan in TV commercials and newspaper advertisements. People's attitudes differ concerning the effectiveness of these programs. My personal view is that the benefits of these courses are overly exaggerated. In fact, more harm than good might be done to kids who attend these courses.

The possible negative influence includes: 1) affecting children's physical health; 2) stifling creativity and 3) delaying the development of kids' social communication skills. Play is an essential part of kid's physical well-being in that the exercises involved help build strong muscles and the sunshine received in outdoor activities is an important source of vitamin D which plays an important part in the strengthening of bone structures. Also, playing makes kids smarter and more creative. By solving problems in play activities like hide-and-seek and toy bricks, their intelligence and brainpower will be significantly enhanced. Another aspect that play brings is the improved social communication skills developed among peer playmates. By denying kids chances of play and forcing them to attend the so-called intelligence-enhancing courses, we are running the risk of depriving kids of the precious opportunities of physical, mental and social skills developments.

However, some parents believe the pre-school courses could prepare kids for the up-coming formal education they would receive. Given the fact of the increasingly fiercer competition and rising unemployment rates, having kids better prepared is what's essential in kids' upbringing. Yet, it must be pointed out that the effectiveness of the pre-school training programs in terms of enhancing children's intelligence is highly doubted in that currently no research has come up with any scientific evidence proving the link between any form of early formal training and talent.

In spite of the increased popularity of pre-school training courses, I personally believe the benefits of the pre-school age training are overblown and the courses themselves shouldn't be encouraged. Parents should give their kids a better, more relaxed and playful environment, because that's what their kids truly need.

The bar chart represents a contrast of various modes of transport when people commute to and from work in one particular European city in 1950, 1970 and 1990.

In 1950, a considerable number of people, accounting fornearly 33%, preferred to walk to work while only roughly 8% of employees had access to cars. Meanwhile, 27% of employees cycled to work while less than 20% of them favored buses.

Two decades later, people who chose buses to work steadily increased by around 8% and the proportion of people who drove cars dramatically rose to 25%. In contrast, riding a bike and walking demonstrated a tendency of decline, reducing to less than 25% and 15% respectively.

From 1970 to 1990, the private cars continuously remained the favorite mode of transport among the city dwellers, soaring by at least 12%. Buses, however, were not as popular as they used to be, descending by no less than 10%. Similarly，the proportion of bikers continued the shrinking trend and drastically plunged to 7%. Besides, an increasing number of people were reluctant to go to work on foot, representing 10% of the total commuters.

The four decades from 1950 to 1990 saw a substantial decrease in bike-riding and walking, but significant surge in car-driving. Buses, however, failed to follow a consistent trend, ascending first and then dropping.

","This model has been prepared by an examiner and has achieved a Band 8 score. However, please note that this is just one example out of many possible approaches.

In current society，no one can deny the role of family backgrounds in the education of children. Although most parents hold the view that children brought up in impoverished families are likely to deal with problems better than those in affluent families, they are still willing to spare no effort so as to ensure a stable life for their children.

It is undeniable that growing up in a poor household may help foster certain essential qualities conducive to the individual’s success. Children of low economic status often grow up to be more physically, mentally and professionally self-reliant. In most cases, what they desire of go beyond their parents’ means and they have to come to terms with the depressing sense of frustration and rejection. Hence, they might better be able to cope with stress in adult life and less likely to get panic when problems occur. Besides, their parents’ repeated denial of their material request is beneficial for their cultivating sense of frugality.

In terms of the children’s physical and psychological development, however, rich families can afford material and emotional well-being that poor families fall short of. For one thing, children from wealthy families usually have easy access to entertainment and pleasure, which may broaden their mind and decrease the rate of psychological illness. For another, children in rich families are healthier than their poor counterparts because of the nutritious food and attentive healthcare provided by their parents. Above all, wealthy parents have the adequate financial resources to offer their offspring better schooling.

In spite of the possible advantages of growing up in needy families, I firmly believe that being rich may enable the children to enjoy a stable and positive lifestyle, their abilities to deal with various problems.

","This model has been prepared by an examiner and has achieved a Band 8 score. However, please note that this is just one example out of many possible approaches.

The table demonstrates the statistics on income, tax and rent in five cities all over the world. In terms of average hourly wage, Berlin and Tokyo rank high, reaching average 13 and 12 pounds per hour respectively. Singapore and Berlin, however, offer the lowest hourly wage, only 3 and 4 pounds. Employees in Paris earn 7 pounds per hour.

Compared with the wage, Paris residents pay much more tax than those in other five cities, up to 31.3% of wage. Tax rates of Berlin and Tokyo are 26.6% and 19.3%. Due to the relatively low wage, employees in Athens and Singapore only pay 18.9% and 15% of their wage as tax.

Despite similar wage, Berlin and Tokyo see a sharp contrast in the monthly rent, amounting to 1300 pounds and 5300 pounds. Compared with the lowest wage of 4 pounds, the rental expenditure of 2400 pounds in Singapore seems quite out of proportion to the income.

Based on the above illustration, it is evident that facing low income and relatively high rent, Singapore residents have to tighten their budget in the hope of surviving in this metropolis while people in Berlin enjoy high quality life because of their generous income and reasonable rent.

","This model has been prepared by an examiner and has achieved a Band 8 score. However, please note that this is just one example out of many possible approaches.

Recently, the soaring crime rate in most counties gives rise to the detailed report of crime. It is true that a large proportion of space and time is dedicated to the exhaustive crime stories so as to arouse the public curiosity of the criminal acts. As far as I am concerned, such excessive coverage of crimes brings about more evil than good.

Admittedly, informed of such reports, the public may be on alert to the potential crimes, which may decrease the crime rate. Bearing those criminal details in mind, common people are capable of taking precaution beforehand. If the media fails to provide such instructive example, it would be extremely hard for the individual’s to detect those lawbreakers. Owing to such abundant coverage of the criminal’s tricks accessible to the public, those potential offenders may ponder over the disastrous consequence of their reckless behavior and nip those wrongdoings in the bud.

Given the advantages illustrated above, there is no denying that these extravagant reports may be detrimental to the individual as well as the whole society. As the fundamental motive of the media is noting but to boost newspaper circulation or the audience rating, the details of the crime is very likely to be exaggerated or fabricated, which may stir the peaceful and carefree life and leave the masses in severe panic. Furthermore, such reports are less likely to prevent crimes than provide instructive learning material for those potential offenders to avoid loopholes in their future plot. Consequently, it will be increasingly difficult for the police to identify and capture them.

Although detailed reports of crimes may carry certain benefits, this view definitely overlooks the even more obvious risks. The media authority concerned is supposed to discourage the undue coverage simply aimed at the crime-obsessed group.

What are the causes of water crisis and how can we solve this problem?

You should use your own ideas, knowledge and experience and support your arguments with examples and relevant evidence.

You should write at least 250 words.
","With the human society is progressing rapidly in various aspects, many problems have arisen, an urgent one of which is the scarcity of water. The overwhelming majority of countries around the world are afflicted with this crisis. In this essay, the causes and solutions will be explored so as to resolve this disturbing issue.

It is evident that wide range of factors may contribute to this crisis. In the first place, the population explosion is the root cause of the problem. Due to the soaring population, water consumption, household or industrial, has been unprecedentedly surging. In the second place, continuously deterioration of the ecosystem may also account for the crisis. Lack of the sense of ecological balance, countless plants and factories discharge contaminative waste into rivers and lakes, which aggravates the ever-shrinking drinkable water resource. Another contributing factor lies in the insufficient public awareness of the water conservation. It is not rare to see the tap dripping and the pipe leaking day and night, a large amount of water squandered.

In light of these facts, a series of measures should be adopted to tackle this problem. To begin with, top priority should be given to the restriction of the staggering increase of population. Only in this way we can curb the ever-growing demand for fresh water. Furthermore, the concept of sustainable development should be promoted in the international community. Joint efforts are supposed to be made by individuals as well as various industries to cease wasting and contaminating the nonrenewable water resource. Last but not least, it is of great importance for the relevant scientific research institute to seek alternative source of fresh water. Doubtlessly, technological advance will enable us to recycle the used water, hence relieving the strain on the water supply.

As several factors lead to water scarcity, steps in different aspects should be effectively taken, such as birth control, implementation of sustainable development and the seeking of alternative water resource. I am quite convinced that this urgent issue will be resolved in no time.
","","This well-developed answer addresses the issues relevantly and at length and it is easy to follow with clear paragraphing and linking of ideas.

What are the causes of water scarcity and how can we solve this problem?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

Write at least 250 words.
","In the present-day society, the unprecedented rate of technology development has brought human beings more comfort and convenience. Nonetheless, in the meantime, many problems emerge, a disturbing one of which is the problem of water scarcity. The issue has aroused a great deal of concern. In this essay, I will pinpoint some possible causes of the phenomenon and then put forward some possible solutions.

It is manifest that the causes of water shortage are manifold. In the first place, global warming is one of the direct reasons. Over the past decade, the world has become a much warmer place, leading to much fastened evaporation process and less water in the atmosphere and on the earth surface. In the second place, water shortage occurs also due to the staggering rate of population growth. The world population boomed after the Second World War, putting more pressure on the already limited global resources. Thirdly, the construction of water dams also results in water dearth. For instance, the Three Gorges Dam project cut the water from upper reaches of the Yangtze River, leaving the lower reaches much drier than before.

On the basis of the above reasoning, the solutions to this issue should also be multifarious. First, new watering technologies should be adopted. For instance, farmers could be given subsidiaries to install water saving equipments, so that the same watering effect can be achieved using much less water. Also, people should receive more publicity on water conservation. Indeed, water saving called for everyone’s effort on everyday routine. Above all, car owners should be encouraged to use clean energies. Research has proven that harmful emission is the direct cause of global warming.

To summarize, several factors give rise to water shortage. I firmly believe that by adopting measures including encouraging the use of new watering technology, raising people’s awareness and using cleaner energy, the problem of water scarcity can be successfully tackled.

The sample Answer shows a large vocabulary (e.g. unprecedented, manifest, manifold, staggering, multifarious, subsidiaries, tackled) and the author’s ability to handle more complex structures (e.g. the second sentence of the first paragraph, the second and fourth sentences of the second paragraph).

","The diagram depicts the lifecycle of a frog from an egg to an adult and the line graph illustrates the number of the fully-grown amphibians in a pond.

According to the diagram, the lifecycle of a frog can be divided into 5 stages. Initially, some eggs are laid by a female frog. Then one of the eggs hatches and a tadpole with no leg and a long tail appears. After some time, two legs emerge under the belly of the little creature. The legs develop and get stronger; meanwhile the tail becomes shorter and thinner. Until at the fifth stage, a fully developed frog appears. And then the whole cycle starts over again.

Then the line graph shows the number of adult frogs in a pond from May to October. Starting from May, the number of grown frogs steadily increased from 20 to around 35 in mid-July. In mid-August, the number soared to about 95. Then the number dropped throughout September and October, to around 35 in mid-October.
