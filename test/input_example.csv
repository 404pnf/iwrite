"<strong>1. 很多人认为有必要举行口语考试，理由是<br />
2. 也有人持反对意见<br />
3. 我的看法及原因</strong>","<div style=""text-align: justify""> A test of spoken English will be included as an optional (component of the College English Test (CET). Some people contend that it is absolutely necessary to hold a test of spoken English in China because we have been told many times that a Chinese student who has been learning English for years cannot communicate with a native English speaker. Sometimes even those top students who excel at grammar and writing skills find their English inadequate to express their thoughts freely when speaking. A test of spoken English will bring the importance of speaking English to the awareness of the college students, and thus help them with their communicating skills.<br />
<br />
 On the other hand, there are also people who maintain that good reading and writing skills would be enough for the average English learners. College students are already under considerable pressure from their coursework. Another required test will only add to their burden. Also, some students may take the shortcut and only practice the questions according to the fixed format of the test, which will not actually improve their spoken English.<br />
<br />
 I believe that a test of spoken English will do more good than harm. Since China will continue its policy of openingand reform, the ability to speak fluent English is a must for anyone who wants to surpass others in a highly competitive society. Whether I take the test or not, I shall make all efforts to practice my spoken English in the rest years in college.</div>",,,自建短文写作,

<div style=""text-align: center; margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"" align=""center""><b>Should Career Planning Be Done Early?</b></div>
<div style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">What we learn as our major at college determines what kind of job we are to take after graduation to a great extent.</div>
<div style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">Some students, before entering the college, start to think about their job prospects. They are strong-minded and purposeful. They have a thorough knowledge about themselves: they know the relative strengths and weaknesses of their personality; they know their interests and specialties. With a right choice of a satisfactory major, they are making steady progress to their potential career at college.</div>
<div style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"">Some students, however, are not as decisive as the above ones. They are confused about their future jobs. Blindly, they choose their major, but quickly lose the interest in pursuing it or find it unsuitable for themselves. They spend the whole college period doing nothing but complaining and regretting.</div>
<span style=""font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%"">In my opinion, it is essential for students to make a right choice of major before they start their college study. Both schools and parents have to take the responsibility of cultivating youngsters&rsquo; sense of career planning and sense of independence. Only in this way, can college life be a happy and beneficial experience for more students.</span>",,此作文是一篇讨论大学生职业规划的议论文。根据提纲，考生首先需要交待进行职业规划的背景，其次对比对待职业规划的不同态度，最后通过对比的结果得出大学生应该尽早进行职业规划的结论，属于观点对比题。范文首先指出大学生在校所学专业在很大程度上决定其职业的方向。第二段分析提早进行职业规划的好处：一些学生在入学前就开始思考自己的职业问题，他们对自身的性格、特长、兴趣更为了解，因而能够选择合适的专业，在择业的时候能够更有针对性；第三段则讨论反面的例子：另外一些学生对自己的职业毫无规划，对所学专业没有兴趣，虚度了大学时光。最后，作者总结大学生在入学前有必要选择好自己的专业。而学校和家长也应引导学生培养职业规划的意识和独立意识。只有这样，大学生活才能有意义。,自建短文写作,
"1.	Write a short summary of the news item, which should include:
?	Teenager smoking in China
?	The role of government  in keeping teenagers from smoking
2.	Give your comments on the theme of Tobacco-Free Youth.
",,,"China's production and consumption of cigarettes have ranked first in the world. One of every three cigarettes manufactured in the world is consumed in China. Three of every five Chinese smokers begin smoking at the age of 15–20 years. Teenage smoking is increasingly becoming a problem in modern China. At least 50 million of the children now living in China will be killed by smoking. Therefore China's top priority in control of smoking is to educate the youth against smoking so as to prevent them from starting and reduce the overall number of new smokers. Adults smoke; children follow. Thus a major feature of China's smoking control efforts has been the mobilization of primary school children to advise their parents to stop smoking.

The goal of the Chinese Association on Smoking and Health is to achieve a male (age 15+) smoking rate below 58% and a female (age 15+) smoking rate below 5% by the year 2000. Although the number of smoke-free schools is on the increase and many more teenagers are quitting, China still has a long way to go.

In these years, to protect the environment, the local government here has taken strict actions. They closed many small factoriesand set limits on fishingso asto expand the size of the wetland.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify""> These polices have already resulted in desirable effects. More and more birds are coming here for winter because of the improved environment, including some rare ones.</p>
